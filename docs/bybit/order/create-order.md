# Place Order

This endpoint supports to create the order for Spot, Margin trading, USDT perpetual, USDT futures, USDC perpetual, USDC futures, Inverse Futures and Options.

info

  * **Supported order type (`orderType`):**  
Limit order: `orderType`=_Limit_ , it is necessary to specify order qty and price.  


[Market order](https://www.bybit.com/en/help-center/article/Types-of-Orders-Available-on-Bybit): `orderType`=_Market_ , execute at the best price in the Bybit market until the transaction is completed. When selecting a market order, the "price" can be empty. In the futures trading system, in order to protect traders against the serious slippage of the Market order, Bybit trading engine will convert the market order into an IOC limit order for matching. If there are no orderbook entries within price slippage limit, the order will not be executed. If there is insufficient liquidity, the order will be cancelled. The slippage threshold refers to the percentage that the order price deviates from the mark price. You can learn more here: [Adjustments to Bybit's Derivative Trading Price Limit Mechanism](https://announcements.bybit.com/en/article/adjustments-to-bybit-s-derivative-trading-limit-order-mechanism-blt469228de1902fff6/)
  * **Supported timeInForce strategy:**  
`GTC`  
`IOC`  
`FOK`  
`PostOnly`: If the order would be filled immediately when submitted, it will be **cancelled**. The purpose of this is to protect your order during the submission process. If the matching system cannot entrust the order to the order book due to price changes on the market, it will be cancelled.  
`RPI`: Retail Price Improvement order. Assigned market maker can place this kind of order, and it is a post only order, only match with the order from Web or APP.

  * **How to create a conditional order:**  
When submitting an order, if `triggerPrice` is set, the order will be automatically converted into a conditional order. In addition, the conditional order does not occupy the margin. If the margin is insufficient after the conditional order is triggered, the order will be cancelled.

  * **[Take profit / Stop loss](https://www.bybit.com/en/help-center/article/Introduction-to-Take-Profit-Stop-Loss-Perpetual-Futures-Contracts)** : You can set TP/SL while placing orders. Besides, you could modify the position's TP/SL.

  * **Order quantity** : The quantity of perpetual contracts you are going to buy/sell. For the order quantity, Bybit only supports positive number at present.

  * **Order price** : Place a limit order, this parameter is **required**. If you have position, the price should be higher than the _liquidation price_. For the minimum unit of the price change, please refer to the `priceFilter` > `tickSize` field in the [instruments-info](/docs/v5/market/instrument) endpoint.

  * **orderLinkId** : You can customize the active order ID. We can link this ID to the order ID in the system. Once the active order is successfully created, we will send the unique order ID in the system to you. Then, you can use this order ID to cancel active orders, and if both orderId and orderLinkId are entered in the parameter input, Bybit will prioritize the orderId to process the corresponding order. Meanwhile, your customized order ID should be no longer than 36 characters and should be **unique**.

  * **Open orders up limit:**  
**Perps & Futures:**   
a) Each account can hold a maximum of _500_ **active** orders simultaneously **per symbol.**  
b) **conditional** orders: each account can hold a maximum of **10 active orders** simultaneously **per symbol**.   
**Spot:** 500 orders in total, including a maximum of 30 open TP/SL orders, a maximum of 30 open conditional orders for each symbol per account  
**Option:** a maximum of 50 open orders per account

  * **Rate limit:**  
Please refer to [rate limit table](/docs/v5/rate-limit#trade). If you need to raise the rate limit, please contact your client manager or submit an application via [here](https://www.bybit.com/future-activity/en-US/institutional-services)

  * **Risk control limit notice:**  
Bybit will monitor on your API requests. When the total number of orders of a single user (aggregated the number of orders across main account and subaccounts) within a day (UTC 0 - UTC 24) exceeds a certain upper limit, the platform will reserve the right to remind, warn, and impose necessary restrictions. Customers who use API default to acceptance of these terms and have the obligation to cooperate with adjustments.

  * **Reduce only orders:**  
If reduceOnly=true and order qty > max order qty, the order will automatically be split up into multiple orders.

# 創建委託單

本接口提供幣幣交易，現貨槓桿交易，合約以及期權的訂單創建

信息

  * **支持的訂單類型 (`orderType`):**  
限價單: `orderType`=_Limit_ , 需要指定訂單數量和價格.  


[市價單](https://www.bybit.com/zh-TW/help-center/bybitHC_Article?language=zh_TW&id=000001135): `orderType`=_Market_ , 以Bybit市場內最優的價格一直執行到成交. 選擇市價單時，price 參數為空。在期貨交易系統，為了保護市價單產生嚴重的滑點，Bybit 交易系統會將市價單轉為限價單進行撮合，如果市場價格轉限價時，超過滑點設置的閾值，該筆市場價格訂單將會被取消。滑點閾值是指訂單價格偏離最新成交價格的百分比，目前閾值設置為：BTC 合約3%，其他合約5%。
  * **支持的timeInForce策略:**  
`GTC` 一直有效至取消  
`IOC` 立即成交或取消  
`FOK` 完全成交或取消  
`PostOnly`: 被動委托類型，如果該訂單在提交時會被立即執行成交，它將被**取消**. 這樣做的目的是為了保護您的訂單在提交的過程中，如果因為場內的價格變化，而撮合系統無法委託該筆訂單到訂單簿，因此會被取消。針對 PostOnly 訂單類型，單筆訂單可提交的數量比其他類型的訂單更多，請參考該[接口](/docs/zh-TW/v5/market/instrument)中的`lotSizeFilter > postOnlyMaxOrderQty`參數.  
`RPI`: 提升零售訂單價格流動訂單; 指定做市商允許下此類訂單; 本身具有post only屬性, 但是此訂單僅和來自網頁或者APP端的訂單成交

  * **如何創建條件單:**  
在提交訂單時，如果設置了**triggerPrice** ，則該訂單會自動轉為條件單。另外條件單不佔用保證金，如果條件單觸發後，保證金不足，則該筆訂單會被取消。

  * **[止盈 / 止損](https://www.bybit.com/zh-TW/help-center/bybitHC_Article?language=zh_TW&id=000001138)** : 您可以在下單時設置止盈止損。另外，您可以通過[設置止盈止損](/docs/zh-TW/v5/position/trading-stop)接口修改持倉時的止盈止損價格。

  * **訂單數量** : 訂單數量，只支持正數。

  * **訂單價格** : 下限價單，價格字段**必傳** 。若您有倉位, 下單價格需要高於強平價. 對於設置價格的步長，請參閱該[接口](/docs/zh-TW/v5/market/instrument)中的`priceFilter` > `tickSize`.

  * **用戶自定義訂單Id** : 最大長度不超過36個字符且唯一。您可以自定義設置的订单ID(`orderLinkId`)，我们会为您关联到Bybit系统的唯一订单ID，并把唯一订单ID在活动委托创建成功后一并返回给您（包括Websocket），您可以使用 Bybit 的订单ID 和 orderLinkId 去獲取和取消訂單，如果在參數輸入中同時輸入 orderId 和 orderLinkId，Bybit 會優先以 orderId 為准來處理對應訂單.

  * **訂單持有上限:**  
**期貨:** 單個账户针对合约可持有每个 symbol 最多可同时持有500个普通活动订单。針對**條件單** ，單個帳戶針對合約可持有每個 symbol 最多同時持有 **10** 個條件單  
**現貨:** 單帳戶單交易對: 總計支持500個掛單，包括最多持有30個止盈止損委託單和30個條件單委託單  
**期權:** 單帳戶最多可持有50個委託單

  * **API限頻:**

  * 現貨: 可以通過設置`marketUnit`來表示市價單qty的單位, 市價買單默認是`quoteCoin`, 市價賣單默認是`baseCoin`
  * 期貨和期權: 總是以base coin作為qty的單位
  * 期貨: 如果傳入`qty`="0"以及`reduceOnly`="true", 則可以平掉對應合約可達單個訂單允許的最大qty的倉位, 參照[查詢可交易產品的規格信息](/docs/zh-TW/v5/market/instrument)接口裡的字段`maxMktOrderQty`或者`maxOrderQty`

  
marketUnit| false| string| **現貨交易** 創建市價單時給入參`qty`指定的單位, 支持orderFilter=Order, tpslOrder 和 StopOrder
