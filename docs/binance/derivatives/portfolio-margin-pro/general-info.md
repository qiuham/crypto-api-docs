# General Info

## General API Information[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#general-api-information "Direct link to General API Information")

  * The following base endpoints are available: 
    * **<https://api.binance.com>**
    * **<https://api1.binance.com>**
    * **<https://api2.binance.com>**
    * **<https://api3.binance.com>**
    * **<https://api4.binance.com>**
  * The last 4 endpoints in the point above (`api1`-`api4`) might give better performance but have less stability. Please use whichever works best for your setup.
  * All endpoints return either a JSON object or array.
  * Data is returned in **ascending** order. Oldest first, newest last.
  * All time and timestamp related fields are in **milliseconds**.
  * The base endpoint **<https://data-api.binance.vision>** can be used to access the following API endpoints that have `NONE` as security type: 
    * [GET /api/v3/aggTrades](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#compressed-aggregate-trades-list)
    * [GET /api/v3/avgPrice](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#current-average-price)
    * [GET /api/v3/depth](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#order-book)
    * [GET /api/v3/exchangeInfo](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#exchange-information)

    * [GET /api/v3/uiKlines](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#uiklines)



### HTTP Return Codes[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#http-return-codes "Direct link to HTTP Return Codes")

  * HTTP `4XX` return codes are used for malformed requests; the issue is on the sender's side.
  * HTTP `403` return code is used when the WAF Limit (Web Application Firewall) has been violated.
  * HTTP `409` return code is used when a cancelReplace order partially succeeds. (e.g. if the cancellation of the order fails but the new order placement succeeds.)
  * HTTP `429` return code is used when breaking a request rate limit.
  * HTTP `418` return code is used when an IP has been auto-banned for continuing to send requests after receiving `429` codes.
  * HTTP `5XX` return codes are used for internal errors; the issue is on Binance's side. It is important to **NOT** treat this as a failure operation; the execution status is **UNKNOWN** and could have been a success.



### Error Codes and Messages[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#error-codes-and-messages "Direct link to Error Codes and Messages")

  * If there is an error, the API will return an error with a message of the reason.



> The error payload on API and SAPI is as follows:
    
    
    {  
      "code": -1121,  
      "msg": "Invalid symbol."  
    }  
    

  * Specific error codes and messages defined in [Error Codes](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#error-codes).



### General Information on Endpoints[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#general-information-on-endpoints "Direct link to General Information on Endpoints")

  * For `GET` endpoints, parameters must be sent as a `query string`.
  * For `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` endpoints, the parameters may be sent as a `query string` or in the `request body` with content type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. You may mix parameters between both the `query string` and `request body` if you wish to do so.
  * Parameters may be sent in any order.
  * If a parameter sent in both the `query string` and `request body`, the `query string` parameter will be used.



* * *

## LIMITS[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#limits "Direct link to LIMITS")

### General Info on Limits[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#general-info-on-limits "Direct link to General Info on Limits")

  * The following `intervalLetter` values for headers: 
    * SECOND => S
    * MINUTE => M
    * HOUR => H
    * DAY => D
  * `intervalNum` describes the amount of the interval. For example, `intervalNum` 5 with `intervalLetter` M means "Every 5 minutes".
  * The `/api/v3/exchangeInfo` `rateLimits` array contains objects related to the exchange's `RAW_REQUESTS`, `REQUEST_WEIGHT`, and `ORDERS` rate limits. These are further defined in the `ENUM definitions` section under `Rate limiters (rateLimitType)`.
  * A 429 will be returned when either request rate limit or order rate limit is violated.



### IP Limits[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#ip-limits "Direct link to IP Limits")

  * Every request will contain `X-MBX-USED-WEIGHT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter)` in the response headers which has the current used weight for the IP for all request rate limiters defined.
  * Each route has a `weight` which determines for the number of requests each endpoint counts for. Heavier endpoints and endpoints that do operations on multiple symbols will have a heavier `weight`.
  * When a 429 is received, it's your obligation as an API to back off and not spam the API.
  * **Repeatedly violating rate limits and/or failing to back off after receiving 429s will result in an automated IP ban (HTTP status 418).**
  * IP bans are tracked and **scale in duration** for repeat offenders, **from 2 minutes to 3 days**.
  * A `Retry-After` header is sent with a 418 or 429 responses and will give the **number of seconds** required to wait, in the case of a 429, to prevent a ban, or, in the case of a 418, until the ban is over.
  * **The limits on the API are based on the IPs, not the API keys.**

We recommend using the websocket for getting data as much as possible, as this will not count to the request rate limit. 

### Order Rate Limits[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#order-rate-limits "Direct link to Order Rate Limits")

  * Every successful order response will contain a `X-MBX-ORDER-COUNT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter)` header which has the current order count for the account for all order rate limiters defined.

  * When the order count exceeds the limit, you will receive a 429 error without the `Retry-After` header. Please check the Order Rate Limit rules using `GET api/v3/exchangeInfo` and wait for reactivation accordingly.

  * Rejected/unsuccessful orders are not guaranteed to have `X-MBX-ORDER-COUNT-**` headers in the response.

  * **The order rate limit is counted against each account**.

  * To monitor order count usage, refer to GET `api/v3/rateLimit/order`




### Websocket Limits[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#websocket-limits "Direct link to Websocket Limits")

  * WebSocket connections have a limit of 5 incoming messages per second. A message is considered: 
    * A PING frame
    * A PONG frame
    * A JSON controlled message (e.g. subscribe, unsubscribe)
  * A connection that goes beyond the limit will be disconnected; IPs that are repeatedly disconnected may be banned.
  * A single connection can listen to a maximum of 1024 streams.
  * There is a limit of **300 connections per attempt every 5 minutes per IP**.



### /api/ and /sapi/ Limit Introduction[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#api-and-sapi-limit-introduction "Direct link to /api/ and /sapi/ Limit Introduction")

The `/api/*` and `/sapi/*` endpoints adopt either of two access limiting rules, IP limits or UID (account) limits.

  * Endpoints related to `/api/*`:

    * According to the two modes of IP and UID (account) limit, each are independent.
    * Endpoints share the 6000 per minute limit based on IP.
    * Responses contain the header `X-MBX-USED-WEIGHT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter)`, defining the weight used by the current IP.
    * Successful order responses contain the header `X-MBX-ORDER-COUNT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter)`, defining the order limit used by the UID.
  * Endpoints related to `/sapi/*`:

    * Endpoints are marked according to IP or UID limit and their corresponding weight value.
    * Each endpoint with IP limits has an independent 12000 per minute limit.
    * Each endpoint with UID limits has an independent 180000 per minute limit.
    * Responses from endpoints with IP limits contain the header `X-SAPI-USED-IP-WEIGHT-1M`, defining the weight used by the current IP.
    * Responses from endpoints with UID limits contain the header `X-SAPI-USED-UID-WEIGHT-1M`, defining the weight used by the current UID.



* * *

## Data Sources[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#data-sources "Direct link to Data Sources")

  * The API system is asynchronous, so some delay in the response is normal and expected.
  * Each endpoint has a data source indicating where the data is being retrieved, and thus which endpoints have the most up-to-date response.



These are the three sources, ordered by which is has the most up-to-date response to the one with potential delays in updates.

  * **Matching Engine** \- the data is from the matching Engine
  * **Memory** \- the data is from a server's local or external memory
  * **Database** \- the data is taken directly from a database

Some endpoints can have more than 1 data source. (e.g. Memory => Database)   
  
This means that the endpoint will check the first Data Source, and if it cannot find the value it's looking for it will check the next one. 

## Endpoint security type[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#endpoint-security-type "Direct link to Endpoint security type")

  * Each endpoint has a security type that determines how you will interact with it. This is stated next to the NAME of the endpoint. 
    * If no security type is stated, assume the security type is NONE.
  * API-keys are passed into the Rest API via the `X-MBX-APIKEY` header.
  * API-keys and secret-keys **are case sensitive**.
  * API-keys can be configured to only access certain types of secure endpoints. For example, one API-key could be used for TRADE only, while another API-key can access everything except for TRADE routes.
  * By default, API-keys can access all secure routes.

Security Type| Description  
---|---  
NONE| Endpoint can be accessed freely.  
TRADE| Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key and signature.  
MARGIN| Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key and signature.  
USER_DATA| Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key and signature.  
USER_STREAM| Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key.  
MARKET_DATA| Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key.  
  
  * `TRADE`, `MARGIN` and `USER_DATA` endpoints are `SIGNED` endpoints.



* * *

## SIGNED (TRADE, USER_DATA, AND MARGIN) Endpoint security[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#signed-trade-user_data-and-margin-endpoint-security "Direct link to SIGNED \(TRADE, USER_DATA, AND MARGIN\) Endpoint security")

  * `SIGNED` endpoints require an additional parameter, `signature`, to be sent in the `query string` or `request body`.
  * Endpoints use `HMAC SHA256` signatures. The `HMAC SHA256 signature` is a keyed `HMAC SHA256` operation. Use your `secretKey` as the key and `totalParams` as the value for the HMAC operation.
  * The `signature` is **not case sensitive**.
  * `totalParams` is defined as the `query string` concatenated with the `request body`.



### Timing security[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#timing-security "Direct link to Timing security")

  * A `SIGNED` endpoint also requires a parameter, `timestamp`, to be sent which should be the millisecond timestamp of when the request was created and sent.
  * An additional parameter, `recvWindow`, may be sent to specify the number of milliseconds after `timestamp` the request is valid for. If `recvWindow` is not sent, **it defaults to 5000**.



> The logic is as follows:
    
    
      if (timestamp < (serverTime + 1000) && (serverTime - timestamp) <= recvWindow)  
      {  
        // process request  
      }   
      else   
      {  
        // reject request  
      }  
    

**Serious trading is about timing.** Networks can be unstable and unreliable, which can lead to requests taking varying amounts of time to reach the servers. With `recvWindow`, you can specify that the request must be processed within a certain number of milliseconds or be rejected by the server.

It is recommended to use a small recvWindow of 5000 or less! The max cannot go beyond 60,000!

### SIGNED Endpoint Example for POST /api/v3/order - RSA Keys[​](/docs/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#signed-endpoint-example-for-post-apiv3order---rsa-keys "Direct link to SIGNED Endpoint Example for POST /api/v3/order - RSA Keys")

  * This will be a step by step process how to create the signature payload to send a valid signed payload.
  * We support `PKCS#8` currently.
  * To get your API key, you need to upload your RSA Public Key to your account and a corresponding API key will be provided for you.



For this example, the private key will be referenced as `test-prv-key.pem`

Key| Value  
---|---  
apiKey| CAvIjXy3F44yW6Pou5k8Dy1swsYDWJZLeoK2r8G4cFDnE9nosRppc2eKc1T8TRTQ  
Parameter| Value  
---|---  
symbol| BTCUSDT  
side| SELL  
type| LIMIT  
timeInForce| GTC  
quantity| 1  
price| 0.2  
recvWindow| 5000  
timestamp| 1668481559918  
  
> **Signature payload (with the listed parameters):**
    
    
    symbol=BTCUSDT&side=SELL&type=LIMIT&timeInForce=GTC&quantity=1&price=0.2&timestamp=1668481559918&recvWindow=5000  
    

**Step 1: Construct the payload**

Arrange the list of parameters into a string. Separate each parameter with a `&`.

**Step 2: Compute the signature:**

2.1 - Encode signature payload as ASCII data.

> **Step 2.2**
    
    
     $ echo -n 'symbol=BTCUSDT&side=SELL&type=LIMIT&timeInForce=GTC&quantity=1&price=0.2&timestamp=1668481559918&recvWindow=5000' | openssl dgst -sha256 -sign ./test-prv-key.pem  
    

2.2 - Sign payload using RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 algorithm with SHA-256 hash function.

> **Step 2.3**
    
    
    $  echo -n 'symbol=BTCUSDT&side=SELL&type=LIMIT&timeInForce=GTC&quantity=1&price=0.2&timestamp=1668481559918&recvWindow=5000' | openssl dgst -sha256 -sign ./test-prv-key.pem | openssl enc -base64 -A

2.3 - Encode output as base64 string.

> **Step 2.4**
    
    
    HZ8HOjiJ1s%2FigS9JA%2Bn7%2B7Ti%2FihtkRF5BIWcPIEluJP6tlbFM%2FBf44LfZka%2FiemtahZAZzcO9TnI5uaXh3%2B%2BlrqtNonCwp6%2F245UFWkiW1elpgtVAmJPbogcAv6rSlokztAfWk296ZJXzRDYAtzGH0gq7CgSJKfH%2BXxaCmR0WcvlKjNQnp12%2FeKXJYO4tDap8UCBLuyxDnR7oJKLHQHJLP0r0EAVOOSIbrFang%2F1WOq%2BJaq4Efc4XpnTgnwlBbWTmhWDR1pvS9iVEzcSYLHT%2FfNnMRxFc7u%2Bj3qI%2F%2F5yuGuu14KR0MuQKKCSpViieD%2BfIti46sxPTsjSemoUKp0oXA%3D%3D  
    

2.4 - Since the signature may contain `/` and `=`, this could cause issues with sending the request. So the signature has to be URL encoded.

> **Step 2.5**
    
    
     curl -H "X-MBX-APIKEY: CAvIjXy3F44yW6Pou5k8Dy1swsYDWJZLeoK2r8G4cFDnE9nosRppc2eKc1T8TRTQ" -X POST 'https://api.binance.com/api/v3/order?symbol=BTCUSDT&side=SELL&type=LIMIT&timeInForce=GTC&quantity=1&price=0.2&timestamp=1668481559918recvWindow=5000&signature=HZ8HOjiJ1s%2FigS9JA%2Bn7%2B7Ti%2FihtkRF5BIWcPIEluJP6tlbFM%2FBf44LfZka%2FiemtahZAZzcO9TnI5uaXh3%2B%2BlrqtNonCwp6%2F245UFWkiW1elpgtVAmJPbogcAv6rSlokztAfWk296ZJXzRDYAtzGH0gq7CgSJKfH%2BXxaCmR0WcvlKjNQnp12%2FeKXJYO4tDap8UCBLuyxDnR7oJKLHQHJLP0r0EAVOOSIbrFang%2F1WOq%2BJaq4Efc4XpnTgnwlBbWTmhWDR1pvS9iVEzcSYLHT%2FfNnMRxFc7u%2Bj3qI%2F%2F5yuGuu14KR0MuQKKCSpViieD%2BfIti46sxPTsjSemoUKp0oXA%3D%3D'

# 基本信息

## API 基本信息[​](/docs/zh-CN/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#api-基本信息 "API 基本信息的直接链接")

  * 接口可能需要用户的 API Key，如何创建API-KEY请参考[这里](https://www.binance.com/cn/support/articles/360002502072)
  * 本篇列出接口的 base URL 有: 
    * **<https://api.binance.com>**
    * **<https://api-gcp.binance.com>**
    * **<https://api1.binance.com>**
    * **<https://api2.binance.com>**
    * **<https://api3.binance.com>**
    * **<https://api4.binance.com>**
  * 上述列表的最后4个接口 (`api1`-`api4`) 可能会提供更好的性能，但其稳定性略为逊色。因此，请务必使用最适合您现有配置的那款。
  * 所有接口的响应都是 JSON 格式。
  * 响应中如有数组，数组元素以时间**升序** 排列，越早的数据越提前。
  * 所有时间、时间戳均为UNIX时间，单位为**毫秒** 。
  * 对于仅发送公开市场数据的 API，您可以使用 base URL <https://data-api.binance.vision> 。 
    * GET /api/v3/aggTrades
    * GET /api/v3/avgPrice
    * GET /api/v3/depth
    * GET /api/v3/exchangeInfo
    * GET /api/v3/klines
    * GET /api/v3/ping
    * GET /api/v3/ticker
    * GET /api/v3/ticker/24hr
    * GET /api/v3/ticker/bookTicker
    * GET /api/v3/ticker/price
    * GET /api/v3/time
    * GET /api/v3/trades
    * GET /api/v3/uiKlines



### HTTP 返回代码[​](/docs/zh-CN/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#http-返回代码 "HTTP 返回代码的直接链接")

  * HTTP `4XX` 错误码用于指示错误的请求内容、行为、格式。问题在于请求者。
  * HTTP `403` 错误码表示违反WAF限制(Web应用程序防火墙)。
  * HTTP `409` 错误码表示重新下单(cancelReplace)的请求部分成功。(比如取消订单失败，但是下单成功了)
  * HTTP `429` 错误码表示警告访问频次超限，即将被封IP。
  * HTTP `418` 表示收到429后继续访问，于是被封了。
  * HTTP `5XX` 错误码用于指示Binance服务侧的问题。



### 接口错误代码[​](/docs/zh-CN/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#接口错误代码 "接口错误代码的直接链接")

  * 使用接口 `/api/v3`, 以及 `/sapi/v1/margin`时, 每个接口都有可能抛出异常;



> API 与 SAPI 的错误代码返回形式如下:
    
    
    {  
      "code": -1121,  
      "msg": "Invalid symbol."  
    }  
    

  * 具体的错误码及其解释在 [错误代码](/docs/zh-CN/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#cf68bca02a).



### 接口的基本信息[​](/docs/zh-CN/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#接口的基本信息 "接口的基本信息的直接链接")

  * `GET` 方法的接口, 参数必须在 `query string`中发送。
  * `POST`, `PUT`, 和 `DELETE` 方法的接口,参数可以在内容形式为`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`的 `query string` 中发送，也可以在 `request body` 中发送。 如果你喜欢，也可以混合这两种方式发送参数。
  * 对参数的顺序不做要求。
  * 但如果同一个参数名在query string和request body中都有，query string中的会被优先采用。



* * *

## 访问限制[​](/docs/zh-CN/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#访问限制 "访问限制的直接链接")

### 访问限制基本信息[​](/docs/zh-CN/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#访问限制基本信息 "访问限制基本信息的直接链接")

  * 以下 是`intervalLetter` 作为头部值:

    * SECOND => S
    * MINUTE => M
    * HOUR => H
    * DAY => D
  * 在 `/api/v3/exchangeInfo` `rateLimits` 数组中包含与交易的有关RAW_REQUESTS，REQUEST_WEIGHT和ORDERS速率限制相关的对象。这些在 `限制种类 (rateLimitType)` 下的 `枚举定义` 部分中进一步定义。

  * 违反任何一个速率限制时（访问频次限制或下单速率限制），将返回429。




### IP 访问限制[​](/docs/zh-CN/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#ip-访问限制 "IP 访问限制的直接链接")

  * 每个请求将包含一个`X-MBX-USED-WEIGHT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter)`的头，其中包含当前IP所有请求的已使用权重。
  * 每一个接口均有一个相应的权重(weight)，有的接口根据参数不同可能拥有不同的权重。越消耗资源的接口权重就会越大。
  * 收到429时，您有责任停止发送请求，不得滥用API。
  * **收到429后仍然继续违反访问限制，会被封禁IP，并收到418错误码**
  * 频繁违反限制，封禁时间会逐渐延长，**从最短2分钟到最长3天** 。
  * `Retry-After`的头会与带有418或429的响应发送，并且会给出**以秒为单位** 的等待时长(如果是429)以防止禁令，或者如果是418，直到禁令结束。
  * **访问限制是基于IP的，而不是API Key**

建议您尽可能多地使用websocket消息获取相应数据，以减少请求带来的访问限制压力。 

###下单频率限制

  * 每个成功的下单回报将包含一个`X-MBX-ORDER-COUNT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter)`的头，其中包含当前账户已用的下单限制数量。
  * 当下单数超过限制时，会收到带有429但不含`Retry-After`头的响应。请检查 `GET api/v3/exchangeInfo` 的下单频率限制 (rateLimitType = ORDERS) 并等待封禁时间结束。
  * 被拒绝或不成功的下单并不保证回报中包含以上头内容。
  * **下单频率限制是基于每个账户计数的。**
  * 用户可以通过接口 `GET api/v3/rateLimit/order` 来查询当前的下单量.



### WEB SOCKET 连接限制[​](/docs/zh-CN/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#web-socket-连接限制 "WEB SOCKET 连接限制的直接链接")

  * Websocket服务器每秒最多接受5个消息。消息包括: 
    * PING帧
    * PONG帧
    * JSON格式的消息, 比如订阅, 断开订阅.
  * 如果用户发送的消息超过限制，连接会被断开连接。反复被断开连接的IP有可能被服务器屏蔽。
  * 单个连接最多可以订阅 **1024** 个Streams。
  * 每IP地址、每5分钟最多可以发送300次连接请求。



### /api/ 与 /sapi/ 接口限频说明[​](/docs/zh-CN/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#api-与-sapi-接口限频说明 "/api/ 与 /sapi/ 接口限频说明的直接链接")

`/api/*`接口和 `/sapi/*`接口采用两套不同的访问限频规则, 两者互相独立。

  * `/api/*`的接口相关：

    * 按IP和按UID(account)两种模式分别统计, 两者互相独立。
    * 以 `/api/*`开头的接口按IP限频，**且所有接口共用每分钟6,000限制** 。
    * 每个请求将包含一个 `X-MBX-USED-WEIGHT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter)`的头，包含当前IP所有请求的已使用权重。
    * 每个成功的下单回报将包含一个`X-MBX-ORDER-COUNT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter)`的头，其中包含当前账户已用的下单限制数量。
  * `/sapi/*`的接口相关：

    * 按IP和按UID(account)两种模式分别统计, 两者互相独立。
    * 以`/sapi/*`开头的接口采用**单接口限频模式** 。按IP统计的权重单接口权重总额为每分钟12000；按照UID统计的单接口权重总额是每分钟180000。
    * 每个接口会标明是按照IP或者按照UID统计, 以及相应请求一次的权重值。
    * 按照IP统计的接口, 请求返回头里面会包含`X-SAPI-USED-IP-WEIGHT-1M=<value>`或`X-SAPI-USED-IP-WEIGHT-1S=<value>`, 包含当前IP所有请求已使用权重。
    * 按照UID统计的接口, 请求返回头里面会包含`X-SAPI-USED-UID-WEIGHT-1M=<value>`或`X-SAPI-USED-UID-WEIGHT-1S=<value>`, 包含当前账户所有已用的UID权重。



* * *

## 数据来源[​](/docs/zh-CN/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#数据来源 "数据来源的直接链接")

  * 因为API系统是异步的, 所以返回的数据有延时很正常, 也在预期之中。
  * 在每个接口中，列出了其数据的来源，可以用于理解数据的时效性。



系统一共有3个数据来源，按照更新速度的先后排序。排在前面的数据最新，在后面就有可能存在延迟。

  * **撮合引擎** \- 表示数据来源于撮合引擎
  * **缓存** \- 表示数据来源于内部或者外部的缓存
  * **数据库** \- 表示数据直接来源于数据库

有些接口有不止一个数据源, 比如 `缓存 => 数据库`, 这表示接口会先从第一个数据源检查，如果没有数据，则检查下一个数据源。 

* * *

## 接口鉴权类型[​](/docs/zh-CN/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#接口鉴权类型 "接口鉴权类型的直接链接")

  * 每个接口都有自己的鉴权类型，鉴权类型决定了访问时应当进行何种鉴权。
  * 鉴权类型会在本文档中各个接口名称旁声明，如果没有特殊声明即默认为 `NONE`。
  * 如果需要 API-keys，应当在HTTP头中以 `X-MBX-APIKEY`字段传递。
  * API-keys 与 secret-keys **是大小写敏感的** 。
  * API-keys可以被配置为只拥有访问一些接口的权限。 例如, 一个 API-key 仅可用于发送交易指令, 而另一个 API-key 则可访问除交易指令外的所有路径。
  * 默认 API-keys 可访问所有鉴权路径.

鉴权类型| 描述  
---|---  
NONE| 不需要鉴权的接口  
TRADE| 需要有效的 API-Key 和签名  
MARGIN| 需要有效的 API-Key 和签名  
USER_DATA| 需要有效的 API-Key 和签名  
USER_STREAM| 需要有效的 API-Key  
MARKET_DATA| 需要有效的 API-Key  
  
  * `TRADE`, `MARGIN` 和`USER_DATA` 接口是 签名(SIGNED)接口.



* * *

## SIGNED (TRADE、USER_DATA AND MARGIN) Endpoint security[​](/docs/zh-CN/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#signed-tradeuser_data-and-margin-endpoint-security "SIGNED \(TRADE、USER_DATA AND MARGIN\) Endpoint security的直接链接")

  * 调用`SIGNED` 接口时，除了接口本身所需的参数外，还需要在`query string` 或 `request body`中传递 `signature`, 即签名参数。
  * `签名` **大小写不敏感**.
  * 各种签名方式(比如 HMAC, RSA, Ed25519)，请参考下面的签名的示例。



### 时间同步安全[​](/docs/zh-CN/derivatives/portfolio-margin-pro/general-info#时间同步安全 "时间同步安全的直接链接")

  * 签名接口均需要传递 `timestamp`参数，其值应当是请求发送时刻的unix时间戳(毫秒)。
  * 服务器收到请求时会判断请求中的时间戳，如果是5000毫秒之前发出的，则请求会被认为无效。这个时间空窗值可以通过发送可选参数 `recvWindow`来定义。



> 逻辑伪代码如下:
    
    
      if (timestamp < (serverTime + 1000) && (serverTime - timestamp) <= recvWindow)  
      {  
        // process request  
      }   
      else   
      {  
        // reject request  
      }  
    

**关于交易时效性** 互联网状况并不完全稳定可靠,因此你的程序本地到币安服务器的时延会有抖动。这是我们设置`recvWindow`的目的所在，如果你从事高频交易，对交易时效性有较高的要求，可以灵活设置`recvWindow`以达到你的要求。

推荐使用5秒以下的 recvWindow! 最多不能超过 60秒!

  * 这将逐步介绍如何通过有效的签名发送 payload。
  * 我们接受 `PKCS#8` 格式的 RSA Key。
  * 要获取 API Key，您需要在您的账户上上传您的 RSA Public Key。



对于这个例子，Private Key 将被引用为`test-prv-key.pem`。

**第1步: Payload**

将参数列表排列成一个 string。 用 `&` 分隔每个参数。对于上述参数，签名 payload 如右所示。

**第2步: 计算签名**

2.1 - 将签名有效负载编码为 ASCII 数据。
