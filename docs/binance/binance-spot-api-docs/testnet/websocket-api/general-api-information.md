# General API Information

* The base endpoint is: **`wss://ws-api.testnet.binance.vision/ws-api/v3`**  
    * If you experience issues with the standard 443 port, alternative port 9443 is also available.
  * A single connection to the API is only valid for 24 hours; expect to be disconnected after the 24-hour mark.
  * We support HMAC, RSA, and Ed25519 keys. For more information, please see [API Key types](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/api_key_types).
  * Responses are in JSON by default. To receive responses in SBE, refer to the [SBE FAQ](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/sbe_faq) page.
  * If your request contains a symbol name containing non-ASCII characters, then the response may contain non-ASCII characters encoded in UTF-8.
  * Some methods may return asset and/or symbol names containing non-ASCII characters encoded in UTF-8 even if the request did not contain non-ASCII characters.
  * The WebSocket server will send a `ping frame` every 20 seconds. 
    * If the WebSocket server does not receive a `pong frame` back from the connection within a minute the connection will be disconnected.
    * When you receive a ping, you must send a pong with a copy of ping's payload as soon as possible.
    * Unsolicited `pong frames` are allowed, but will not prevent disconnection. **It is recommended that the payload for these pong frames are empty.**
  * Data is returned in **chronological order** , unless noted otherwise. 
    * Without `startTime` or `endTime`, returns the most recent items up to the limit.
    * With `startTime`, returns oldest items from `startTime` up to the limit.
    * With `endTime`, returns most recent items up to `endTime` and the limit.
    * With both, behaves like `startTime` but does not exceed `endTime`.
  * All timestamps in the JSON responses are in **milliseconds in UTC by default**. To receive the information in microseconds, please add the parameter `timeUnit=MICROSECOND` or `timeUnit=microsecond` in the URL.
  * Timestamp parameters (e.g. `startTime`, `endTime`, `timestamp`) can be passed in milliseconds or microseconds.
  * All field names and values are **case-sensitive** , unless noted otherwise.
  * If there are enums or terms you want clarification on, please see [SPOT Glossary](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/spot_glossary) for more information.
  * APIs have a timeout of 10 seconds when processing a request. If a response from the Matching Engine takes longer than this, the API responds with "Timeout waiting for response from backend server. Send status unknown; execution status unknown." [(-1007 TIMEOUT)](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/errors#-1007-timeout)
    * This does not always mean that the request failed in the Matching Engine.
    * If the status of the request has not appeared in [User Data Stream](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/user-data-stream), please perform an API query for its status.
  * **Please avoid SQL keywords in requests** as they may trigger a security block by a WAF (Web Application Firewall) rule. See <https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/detail/360004492232> for more details.
