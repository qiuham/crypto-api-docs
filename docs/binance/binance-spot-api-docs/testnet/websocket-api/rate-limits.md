# Rate limits

### Connection limits[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/rate-limits#connection-limits "Direct link to Connection limits")

There is a limit of **300 connections per attempt every 5 minutes**.

The connection is per **IP address**.

### General information on rate limits[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/rate-limits#general-information-on-rate-limits "Direct link to General information on rate limits")

  * Current API rate limits can be queried using the [`exchangeInfo`](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/rate-limits#exchange-information) request.
  * There are multiple rate limit types across multiple intervals.
  * Responses can indicate current rate limit status in the optional `rateLimits` field.
  * Requests fail with status `429` when unfilled order count or request rate limits are violated.



#### How to interpret rate limits[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/rate-limits#how-to-interpret-rate-limits "Direct link to How to interpret rate limits")

A response with rate limit status may look like this:
    
    
    {  
        "id": "7069b743-f477-4ae3-81db-db9b8df085d2",  
        "status": 200,  
        "result": {  
            "serverTime": 1656400526260  
        },  
        "rateLimits": [  
            {  
                "rateLimitType": "REQUEST_WEIGHT",  
                "interval": "MINUTE",  
                "intervalNum": 1,  
                "limit": 6000,  
                "count": 70  
            }  
        ]  
    }  
    

The `rateLimits` array describes all currently active rate limits affected by the request.

Name| Type| Mandatory| Description  
---|---|---|---  
`rateLimitType`| ENUM| YES| Rate limit type: `REQUEST_WEIGHT`, `ORDERS`  
`interval`| ENUM| YES| Rate limit interval: `SECOND`, `MINUTE`, `HOUR`, `DAY`  
`intervalNum`| INT| YES| Rate limit interval multiplier  
`limit`| INT| YES| Request limit per interval  
`count`| INT| YES| Current usage per interval  
  
Rate limits are accounted by intervals.

For example, a `1 MINUTE` interval starts every minute. Request submitted at 00:01:23.456 counts towards the 00:01:00 minute's limit. Once the 00:02:00 minute starts, the count will reset to zero again.

Other intervals behave in a similar manner. For example, `1 DAY` rate limit resets at 00:00 UTC every day, and `10 SECOND` interval resets at 00, 10, 20... seconds of each minute.

APIs have multiple rate-limiting intervals. If you exhaust a shorter interval but the longer interval still allows requests, you will have to wait for the shorter interval to expire and reset. If you exhaust a longer interval, you will have to wait for that interval to reset, even if shorter rate limit count is zero.

#### How to show/hide rate limit information[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/rate-limits#how-to-showhide-rate-limit-information "Direct link to How to show/hide rate limit information")

`rateLimits` field is included with every response by default.

However, rate limit information can be quite bulky. If you are not interested in detailed rate limit status of every request, the `rateLimits` field can be omitted from responses to reduce their size.

  * Optional `returnRateLimits` boolean parameter in request.

Use `returnRateLimits` parameter to control whether to include `rateLimits` fields in response to individual requests.

Default request and response:
        
        { "id": 1, "method": "time" }  
        
        
        {  
            "id": 1,  
            "status": 200,  
            "result": { "serverTime": 1656400526260 },  
            "rateLimits": [  
                {  
                    "rateLimitType": "REQUEST_WEIGHT",  
                    "interval": "MINUTE",  
                    "intervalNum": 1,  
                    "limit": 6000,  
                    "count": 70  
                }  
            ]  
        }  
        

Request and response without rate limit status:
        
        { "id": 2, "method": "time", "params": { "returnRateLimits": false } }  
        
        
        { "id": 2, "status": 200, "result": { "serverTime": 1656400527891 } }  
        

  * Optional `returnRateLimits` boolean parameter in connection URL.

If you wish to omit `rateLimits` from all responses by default, use `returnRateLimits` parameter in the query string instead:
        
        wss://ws-api.binance.com:443/ws-api/v3?returnRateLimits=false  
        

This will make all requests made through this connection behave as if you have passed `"returnRateLimits": false`.

If you _want_ to see rate limits for a particular request, you need to explicitly pass the `"returnRateLimits": true` parameter.




**Note:** Your requests are still rate limited if you hide the `rateLimits` field in responses.

### IP limits[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/rate-limits#ip-limits "Direct link to IP limits")

  * Every request has a certain **weight** , added to your limit as you perform requests. 
    * The heavier the request (e.g. querying data from multiple symbols), the more weight the request will cost.
    * Connecting to WebSocket API costs 2 weight.
  * Current weight usage is indicated by the `REQUEST_WEIGHT` rate limit type.
  * Use the [`exchangeInfo`](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/rate-limits#exchange-information) request to keep track of the current weight limits.
  * Weight is accumulated **per IP address** and is shared by all connections from that address.
  * If you go over the weight limit, requests fail with status `429`. 
    * This status code indicates you should back off and stop spamming the API.
    * Rate-limited responses include a `retryAfter` field, indicating when you can retry the request.
  * **Repeatedly violating rate limits and/or failing to back off after receiving 429s will result in an automated IP ban and you will be disconnected.**
    * Requests from a banned IP address fail with status `418`.
    * `retryAfter` field indicates the timestamp when the ban will be lifted.
  * IP bans are tracked and **scale in duration** for repeat offenders, **from 2 minutes to 3 days**.



Successful response indicating that in 1 minute you have used 70 weight out of your 6000 limit:
    
    
    {  
        "id": "7069b743-f477-4ae3-81db-db9b8df085d2",  
        "status": 200,  
        "result": [],  
        "rateLimits": [  
            {  
                "rateLimitType": "REQUEST_WEIGHT",  
                "interval": "MINUTE",  
                "intervalNum": 1,  
                "limit": 6000,  
                "count": 70  
            }  
        ]  
    }  
    

Failed response indicating that you are banned and the ban will last until epoch `1659146400000`:
    
    
    {  
        "id": "fc93a61a-a192-4cf4-bb2a-a8f0f0c51e06",

            }  
        },  
        "rateLimits": [

            }  
        ]  
    }  
    

### Unfilled Order Count[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/rate-limits#unfilled-order-count "Direct link to Unfilled Order Count")

  * Successfully placed orders update the `ORDERS` rate limit type.
  * Rejected or unsuccessful orders might or might not update the `ORDERS` rate limit type.
  * **Please note that if your orders are consistently filled by trades, you can continuously place orders on the API**. For more information, please see [Spot Unfilled Order Count Rules](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/order_count_decrement).
  * Use the [`account.rateLimits.orders`](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/account-requests#query-unfilled-order-count) request to keep track of how many orders you have placed within this interval.
  * If you exceed this, requests fail with status `429`. 
    * This status code indicates you should back off and stop spamming the API.
    * Responses that have a status `429` include a `retryAfter` field, indicating when you can retry the request.
  * This is maintained **per account** and is shared by all API keys of the account.

# Rate limits

### Connection limits[​](/docs/zh-CN/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/rate-limits#connection-limits "Connection limits的直接链接")

There is a limit of **300 connections per attempt every 5 minutes**.

The connection is per **IP address**.

### General information on rate limits[​](/docs/zh-CN/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/rate-limits#general-information-on-rate-limits "General information on rate limits的直接链接")

  * Current API rate limits can be queried using the [`exchangeInfo`](/docs/zh-CN/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/rate-limits#exchange-information) request.
  * There are multiple rate limit types across multiple intervals.
  * Responses can indicate current rate limit status in the optional `rateLimits` field.
  * Requests fail with status `429` when unfilled order count or request rate limits are violated.



#### How to interpret rate limits[​](/docs/zh-CN/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/rate-limits#how-to-interpret-rate-limits "How to interpret rate limits的直接链接")

A response with rate limit status may look like this:
    
    
    {  
        "id": "7069b743-f477-4ae3-81db-db9b8df085d2",  
        "status": 200,  
        "result": {  
            "serverTime": 1656400526260  
        },  
        "rateLimits": [  
            {  
                "rateLimitType": "REQUEST_WEIGHT",  
                "interval": "MINUTE",  
                "intervalNum": 1,  
                "limit": 6000,  
                "count": 70  
            }  
        ]  
    }  
    

The `rateLimits` array describes all currently active rate limits affected by the request.

Name| Type| Mandatory| Description  
---|---|---|---  
`rateLimitType`| ENUM| YES| Rate limit type: `REQUEST_WEIGHT`, `ORDERS`  
`interval`| ENUM| YES| Rate limit interval: `SECOND`, `MINUTE`, `HOUR`, `DAY`  
`intervalNum`| INT| YES| Rate limit interval multiplier  
`limit`| INT| YES| Request limit per interval  
`count`| INT| YES| Current usage per interval  
  
Rate limits are accounted by intervals.

For example, a `1 MINUTE` interval starts every minute. Request submitted at 00:01:23.456 counts towards the 00:01:00 minute's limit. Once the 00:02:00 minute starts, the count will reset to zero again.

Other intervals behave in a similar manner. For example, `1 DAY` rate limit resets at 00:00 UTC every day, and `10 SECOND` interval resets at 00, 10, 20... seconds of each minute.

APIs have multiple rate-limiting intervals. If you exhaust a shorter interval but the longer interval still allows requests, you will have to wait for the shorter interval to expire and reset. If you exhaust a longer interval, you will have to wait for that interval to reset, even if shorter rate limit count is zero.

#### How to show/hide rate limit information[​](/docs/zh-CN/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/rate-limits#how-to-showhide-rate-limit-information "How to show/hide rate limit information的直接链接")

`rateLimits` field is included with every response by default.

However, rate limit information can be quite bulky. If you are not interested in detailed rate limit status of every request, the `rateLimits` field can be omitted from responses to reduce their size.

  * Optional `returnRateLimits` boolean parameter in request.

Use `returnRateLimits` parameter to control whether to include `rateLimits` fields in response to individual requests.

Default request and response:
        
        { "id": 1, "method": "time" }

            ]  
        }  
        

Request and response without rate limit status:
        
        { "id": 2, "method": "time", "params": { "returnRateLimits": false } }

  * Optional `returnRateLimits` boolean parameter in connection URL.

If you wish to omit `rateLimits` from all responses by default, use `returnRateLimits` parameter in the query string instead:
        
        wss://ws-api.binance.com:443/ws-api/v3?returnRateLimits=false
