Response fields:

Name | Type | Mandatory | Description  
---|---|---|---  
`id` | INT / STRING / `null` | YES | Same as in the original request  
`status` | INT | YES | Response status. See [Status codes](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/response-format#status-codes)  
`result` | OBJECT / ARRAY | YES | Response content. Present if request succeeded  
`error` | OBJECT | Error description. Present if request failed  
`rateLimits` | ARRAY | NO | Rate limiting status. See [Rate limits](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/response-format#rate-limits)  
  
### Status codes[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/websocket-api/response-format#status-codes "Direct link to Status codes")

Status codes in the `status` field are the same as in HTTP.

Here are some common status codes that you might encounter:

  * `200` indicates a successful response.
  * `4XX` status codes indicate invalid requests; the issue is on your side. 
    * `400` – your request failed, see `error` for the reason.
    * `403` – you have been blocked by the Web Application Firewall. This can indicate a rate limit violation or a security block. See <https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/detail/360004492232> for more details.
    * `409` – your request partially failed but also partially succeeded, see `error` for details.
    * `418` – you have been auto-banned for repeated violation of rate limits.
    * `429` – you have exceeded API request rate limit, please slow down.
  * `5XX` status codes indicate internal errors; the issue is on Binance's side. 
    * **Important:** If a response contains 5xx status code, it **does not** necessarily mean that your request has failed. Execution status is _unknown_ and the request might have actually succeeded. Please use query methods to confirm the status. You might also want to establish a new WebSocket connection for that.
