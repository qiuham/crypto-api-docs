# Data sources

* The API system is asynchronous. Some delay in the response is normal and expected.

  * Each method has a data source indicating where the data is coming from, and thus how up-to-date it is.


Data Source| Latency| Description  
---|---|---  
Matching Engine| lowest| The Matching Engine produces the response directly  
Memory| low| Data is fetched from API server's local or external memory cache  
Database| moderate| Data is retrieved from the database  
  
  * Some methods have more than one data source (e.g., Memory => Database).

This means that the API will look for the latest data in that order: first in the cache, then in the database.
