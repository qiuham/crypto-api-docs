# General API Information

* The base endpoint is **<https://testnet.binance.vision/api>**
  * Responses are in JSON by default. To receive responses in SBE, refer to the [SBE FAQ](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/sbe_faq) page.
  * Data is returned in **chronological order** , unless noted otherwise. 
    * Without `startTime` or `endTime`, returns the most recent items up to the limit.
    * With `startTime`, returns oldest items from `startTime` up to the limit.
    * With `endTime`, returns most recent items up to `endTime` and the limit.
    * With both, behaves like `startTime` but does not exceed `endTime`.
  * All time and timestamp related fields in the JSON responses are in **milliseconds by default.** To receive the information in microseconds, please add the header `X-MBX-TIME-UNIT:MICROSECOND` or `X-MBX-TIME-UNIT:microsecond`.
  * We support HMAC, RSA, and Ed25519 keys. For more information, please see [API Key types](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/api_key_types).
  * Timestamp parameters (e.g. `startTime`, `endTime`, `timestamp`) can be passed in milliseconds or microseconds.
  * If there are enums or terms you want clarification on, please see the [SPOT Glossary](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/spot_glossary) for more information.
  * APIs have a timeout of 10 seconds when processing a request. If a response from the Matching Engine takes longer than this, the API responds with "Timeout waiting for response from backend server. Send status unknown; execution status unknown." [(-1007 TIMEOUT)](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/errors#-1007-timeout)
    * This does not always mean that the request failed in the Matching Engine.
    * If the status of the request has not appeared in [User Data Stream](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/user-data-stream), please perform an API query for its status.
  * **Please avoid SQL keywords in requests** as they may trigger a security block by a WAF (Web Application Firewall) rule. See <https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/detail/360004492232> for more details.
  * If your request contains a symbol name containing non-ASCII characters, then the response may contain non-ASCII characters encoded in UTF-8.
  * Some endpoints may return asset and/or symbol names containing non-ASCII characters encoded in UTF-8 even if the request did not contain non-ASCII characters.
