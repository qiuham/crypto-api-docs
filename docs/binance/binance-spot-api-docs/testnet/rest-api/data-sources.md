# Data Sources

* The API system is asynchronous, so some delay in the response is normal and expected.
  * Each endpoint has a data source indicating where the data is being retrieved, and thus which endpoints have the most up-to-date response.



These are the three sources, ordered by least to most potential for delays in data updates.

  * **Matching Engine** \- the data is from the Matching Engine
  * **Memory** \- the data is from a server's local or external memory
  * **Database** \- the data is taken directly from a database



Some endpoints can have more than 1 data source. (e.g. Memory => Database) This means that the endpoint will check the first Data Source, and if it cannot find the value it's looking for it will check the next one.
