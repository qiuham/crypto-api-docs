# Filters

Filters define trading rules on a symbol or an exchange. Filters come in three forms: `symbol filters`, `exchange filters` and `asset filters`.

## Symbol filters[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/filters#symbol-filters "Direct link to Symbol filters")

### PRICE_FILTER[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/filters#price_filter "Direct link to PRICE_FILTER")

The `PRICE_FILTER` defines the `price` rules for a symbol. There are 3 parts:

  * `minPrice` defines the minimum `price`/`stopPrice` allowed; disabled on `minPrice` == 0.
  * `maxPrice` defines the maximum `price`/`stopPrice` allowed; disabled on `maxPrice` == 0.
  * `tickSize` defines the intervals that a `price`/`stopPrice` can be increased/decreased by; disabled on `tickSize` == 0.



Any of the above variables can be set to 0, which disables that rule in the `price filter`. In order to pass the `price filter`, the following must be true for `price`/`stopPrice` of the enabled rules:

  * `price` >= `minPrice`
  * `price` <= `maxPrice`
  * `price` % `tickSize` == 0



**/exchangeInfo format:**
    
    
    {  
        "filterType": "PRICE_FILTER",  
        "minPrice": "0.00000100",  
        "maxPrice": "100000.00000000",  
        "tickSize": "0.00000100"  
    }  
    

### PERCENT_PRICE[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/filters#percent_price "Direct link to PERCENT_PRICE")

The `PERCENT_PRICE` filter defines the valid range for the price based on the average of the previous trades. `avgPriceMins` is the number of minutes the average price is calculated over. 0 means the last price is used.

In order to pass the `percent price`, the following must be true for `price`:

  * `price` <= `weightedAveragePrice` * `multiplierUp`
  * `price` >= `weightedAveragePrice` * `multiplierDown`



**/exchangeInfo format:**
    
    
    {  
        "filterType": "PERCENT_PRICE",  
        "multiplierUp": "1.3000",  
        "multiplierDown": "0.7000",  
        "avgPriceMins": 5  
    }  
    

### PERCENT_PRICE_BY_SIDE[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/filters#percent_price_by_side "Direct link to PERCENT_PRICE_BY_SIDE")

The `PERCENT_PRICE_BY_SIDE` filter defines the valid range for the price based on the average of the previous trades.  
`avgPriceMins` is the number of minutes the average price is calculated over. 0 means the last price is used.   
There is a different range depending on whether the order is placed on the `BUY` side or the `SELL` side.

Buy orders will succeed on this filter if:

  * `Order price` <= `weightedAveragePrice` * `bidMultiplierUp`
  * `Order price` >= `weightedAveragePrice` * `bidMultiplierDown`



Sell orders will succeed on this filter if:

  * `Order Price` <= `weightedAveragePrice` * `askMultiplierUp`
  * `Order Price` >= `weightedAveragePrice` * `askMultiplierDown`



**/exchangeInfo format:**
    
    
    {  
        "filterType": "PERCENT_PRICE_BY_SIDE",  
        "bidMultiplierUp": "1.2",  
        "bidMultiplierDown": "0.2",  
        "askMultiplierUp": "5",  
        "askMultiplierDown": "0.8",  
        "avgPriceMins": 1  
    }  
    

### LOT_SIZE[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/filters#lot_size "Direct link to LOT_SIZE")

The `LOT_SIZE` filter defines the `quantity` (aka "lots" in auction terms) rules for a symbol. There are 3 parts:

  * `minQty` defines the minimum `quantity`/`icebergQty` allowed.
  * `maxQty` defines the maximum `quantity`/`icebergQty` allowed.
  * `stepSize` defines the intervals that a `quantity`/`icebergQty` can be increased/decreased by.



In order to pass the `lot size`, the following must be true for `quantity`/`icebergQty`:

  * `quantity` >= `minQty`
  * `quantity` <= `maxQty`
  * `quantity` % `stepSize` == 0



**/exchangeInfo format:**
    
    
    {  
        "filterType": "LOT_SIZE",  
        "minQty": "0.00100000",  
        "maxQty": "100000.00000000",  
        "stepSize": "0.00100000"  
    }  
    

### MIN_NOTIONAL[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/filters#min_notional "Direct link to MIN_NOTIONAL")

The `MIN_NOTIONAL` filter defines the minimum notional value allowed for an order on a symbol. An order's notional value is the `price` * `quantity`. `applyToMarket` determines whether or not the `MIN_NOTIONAL` filter will also be applied to `MARKET` orders. Since `MARKET` orders have no price, the average price is used over the last `avgPriceMins` minutes. `avgPriceMins` is the number of minutes the average price is calculated over. 0 means the last price is used.

**/exchangeInfo format:**
    
    
    {  
        "filterType": "MIN_NOTIONAL",  
        "minNotional": "0.00100000",  
        "applyToMarket": true,

    }  
    

### NOTIONAL[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/filters#notional "Direct link to NOTIONAL")

The `NOTIONAL` filter defines the acceptable notional range allowed for an order on a symbol.   
  
`applyMinToMarket` determines whether the `minNotional` will be applied to `MARKET` orders.   
`applyMaxToMarket` determines whether the `maxNotional` will be applied to `MARKET` orders.

In order to pass this filter, the notional (`price * quantity`) has to pass the following conditions:

  * `price * quantity` <= `maxNotional`
  * `price * quantity` >= `minNotional`



For `MARKET` orders, the average price used over the last `avgPriceMins` minutes will be used for calculation.   
If the `avgPriceMins` is 0, then the last price will be used.

**/exchangeInfo format:**
    
    
    {  
        "filterType": "NOTIONAL",  
        "minNotional": "10.00000000",  
        "applyMinToMarket": false,  
        "maxNotional": "10000.00000000",  
        "applyMaxToMarket": false,  
        "avgPriceMins": 5  
    }  
    

### ICEBERG_PARTS[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/filters#iceberg_parts "Direct link to ICEBERG_PARTS")

  * `minQty` defines the minimum `quantity` allowed.
  * `maxQty` defines the maximum `quantity` allowed.
  * `stepSize` defines the intervals that a `quantity` can be increased/decreased by.



In order to pass the `market lot size`, the following must be true for `quantity`:

  * `quantity` >= `minQty`
  * `quantity` <= `maxQty`
  * `quantity` % `stepSize` == 0



**/exchangeInfo format:**
    
    
    {  
        "filterType": "MARKET_LOT_SIZE",  
        "minQty": "0.00100000",  
        "maxQty": "100000.00000000",  
        "stepSize": "0.00100000"  
    }

  1. free balance of the base asset
  2. locked balance of the base asset
  3. sum of the qty of all open BUY orders



`BUY` orders will be rejected if the account's position is greater than the maximum position allowed.

If an order's `quantity` can cause the position to overflow, this will also fail the `MAX_POSITION` filter.

The `MAX_NUM_ALGO_ORDERS` filter defines the maximum number of "algo" orders an account is allowed to have open on a symbol. "Algo" orders are `STOP_LOSS`, `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT`, `TAKE_PROFIT`, and `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` orders.

**/exchangeInfo format:**
    
    
    {  
        "filterType": "MAX_NUM_ALGO_ORDERS",

### MAX_NUM_ICEBERG_ORDERS[​](/docs/zh-CN/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/filters#max_num_iceberg_orders "MAX_NUM_ICEBERG_ORDERS的直接链接")

The `MAX_NUM_ICEBERG_ORDERS` filter defines the maximum number of `ICEBERG` orders an account is allowed to have open on a symbol. An `ICEBERG` order is any order where the `icebergQty` is > 0.

**/exchangeInfo format:**
    
    
    {  
        "filterType": "MAX_NUM_ICEBERG_ORDERS",

### MAX_POSITION[​](/docs/zh-CN/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/filters#max_position "MAX_POSITION的直接链接")

The `MAX_POSITION` filter defines the allowed maximum position an account can have on the base asset of a symbol. An account's position defined as the sum of the account's:

  1. free balance of the base asset
  2. locked balance of the base asset
  3. sum of the qty of all open BUY orders



`BUY` orders will be rejected if the account's position is greater than the maximum position allowed.

If an order's `quantity` can cause the position to overflow, this will also fail the `MAX_POSITION` filter.

**/exchangeInfo format:**
    
    
    {  
        "filterType": "MAX_POSITION",  
        "maxPosition": "10.00000000"  
    }  
    

### TRAILING_DELTA[​](/docs/zh-CN/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/filters#trailing_delta "TRAILING_DELTA的直接链接")

The `TRAILING_DELTA` filter defines the minimum and maximum value for the parameter [`trailingDelta`](/docs/zh-CN/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/trailing-stop-faq.md).

In order for a trailing stop order to pass this filter, the following must be true:

For `STOP_LOSS BUY`, `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT_BUY`,`TAKE_PROFIT SELL` and `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT SELL` orders:

  * `trailingDelta` >= `minTrailingAboveDelta`
  * `trailingDelta` <= `maxTrailingAboveDelta`



For `STOP_LOSS SELL`, `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT SELL`, `TAKE_PROFIT BUY`, and `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT BUY` orders:

  * `trailingDelta` >= `minTrailingBelowDelta`
  * `trailingDelta` <= `maxTrailingBelowDelta`



**/exchangeInfo format:**
    
    
    {  
        "filterType": "TRAILING_DELTA",  
        "minTrailingAboveDelta": 10,  
        "maxTrailingAboveDelta": 2000,  
        "minTrailingBelowDelta": 10,  
        "maxTrailingBelowDelta": 2000  
    }  
    

### MAX_NUM_ORDER_AMENDS[​](/docs/zh-CN/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/filters#max_num_order_amends "MAX_NUM_ORDER_AMENDS的直接链接")

The `MAX_NUM_ORDER_AMENDS` filter defines the maximum number of times an order can be [amended](/docs/zh-CN/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/order_amend_keep_priority.md) on the given symbol.

If there are too many order amendments made on a single order, you will receive the `-2038` error code.

**/exchangeInfo format:**
    
    
    {  
        "filterType": "MAX_NUM_ORDER_AMENDS",

### MAX_NUM_ORDER_LISTS[​](/docs/zh-CN/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/filters#max_num_order_lists "MAX_NUM_ORDER_LISTS的直接链接")

The `MAX_NUM_ORDER_LISTS` filter defines the maximum number of open order lists an account can have on a symbol. Note that OTOCOs count as one order list.

**/exchangeInfo format:**
    
    
    {  
        "filterType": "MAX_NUM_ORDER_LISTS",  
        "maxNumOrderLists": 20

### MAX_ASSET[​](/docs/zh-CN/binance-spot-api-docs/testnet/filters#max_asset "MAX_ASSET的直接链接")

The `MAX_ASSET` filter defines the maximum quantity of an asset that an account is allowed to transact in a single order.

  * When the asset is a symbol's base asset, the limit applies to the order's quantity.
  * When the asset is a symbol's quote asset, the limit applies to the order's notional value.
  * For example, a MAX_ASSET filter for USDC applies to all symbols that have USDC as either a base or quote asset, such as: 
    * USDCBNB
    * BNBUSDC
