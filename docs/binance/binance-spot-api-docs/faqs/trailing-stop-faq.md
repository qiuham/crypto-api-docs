# Spot Trailing Stop order FAQ

### What is a trailing stop order?[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/trailing-stop-faq#what-is-a-trailing-stop-order "Direct link to What is a trailing stop order?")

Trailing stop is a type of contingent order with a dynamic trigger price influenced by price changes in the market. For the SPOT API, the change required to trigger order entry is specified in the `trailingDelta` parameter, and is defined in BIPS.

Intuitively, trailing stop orders allow unlimited price movement in a direction that is beneficial for the order, and limited movement in a detrimental direction.

Buy orders: _low_ prices are good. Unlimited price _decreases_ are allowed but the order will trigger after a price _increase_ of the supplied delta, relative to the _lowest_ trade price since submission.

Sell orders: _high_ prices are good. Unlimited price _increases_ are allowed but the order will trigger after a price _decrease_ of the supplied delta, relative to the _highest_ trade price since submission.

### What are BIPs?[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/trailing-stop-faq#what-are-bips "Direct link to What are BIPs?")

Basis Points, also known as BIP or BIPS, are used to indicate a percentage change.

BIPS conversion reference:

BIPS| Percentage| Multiplier  
---|---|---  
1| 0.01%| 0.0001  
10| 0.1%| 0.001  
100| 1%| 0.01  
1000| 10%| 0.1  
  
For example, a `STOP_LOSS` `SELL` order with a `trailingDelta` of 100 is a trailing stop order which will be triggered after a price decrease of 1% from the highest price after placing the order.

### What order types can be trailing stop orders?[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/trailing-stop-faq#what-order-types-can-be-trailing-stop-orders "Direct link to What order types can be trailing stop orders?")

Trailing stop orders are supported for contingent orders such as `STOP_LOSS`, `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT`, `TAKE_PROFIT`, and `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT`.

OCO orders also support trailing stop orders in the contingent leg. In this scenario if the trailing stop condition is triggered, the limit leg of the OCO order will be canceled.

### How do I place a trailing stop order?[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/trailing-stop-faq#how-do-i-place-a-trailing-stop-order "Direct link to How do I place a trailing stop order?")

Trailing stop orders are entered the same way as regular `STOP_LOSS`, `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT`, `TAKE_PROFIT`, or `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` orders, but with an additional `trailingDelta` parameter. This parameter must be within the range of the `TRAILING_DELTA` filter for that symbol.

Unlike regular contingent orders, the `stopPrice` parameter is optional for trailing stop orders. If it is provided then the order will only start tracking price changes after the `stopPrice` condition is met. If the `stopPrice` parameter is omitted then the order starts tracking price changes from the next trade.

### What kind of price changes will trigger my trailing stop order?[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/trailing-stop-faq#what-kind-of-price-changes-will-trigger-my-trailing-stop-order "Direct link to What kind of price changes will trigger my trailing stop order?")

Trailing order type| Side| Stop price condition| Market price movement required to trigger  
---|---|---|---  
`TAKE_PROFIT`| SELL| market price >= stop price|  _decrease_ from maximum  
`TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT`| SELL| market price >= stop price|  _decrease_ from maximum  
`STOP_LOSS`| SELL| market price <= stop price|  _decrease_ from maximum  
`STOP_LOSS_LIMIT`| SELL| market price <= stop price|  _decrease_ from maximum  
`STOP_LOSS`| BUY| market price >= stop price|  _increase_ from minimum  
`STOP_LOSS_LIMIT`| BUY| market price >= stop price|  _increase_ from minimum  
`TAKE_PROFIT`| BUY| market price <= stop price|  _increase_ from minimum  
`TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT`| BUY| market price <= stop price|  _increase_ from minimum  
  
### How do I pass the `TRAILING_DELTA` filter?[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/trailing-stop-faq#how-do-i-pass-the-trailing_delta-filter "Direct link to how-do-i-pass-the-trailing_delta-filter")

For `STOP_LOSS` `BUY`, `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT` `BUY`, `TAKE_PROFIT` `SELL`, and `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` `SELL` orders:

  * `trailingDelta` >= `minTrailingAboveDelta`
  * `trailingDelta` <= `maxTrailingAboveDelta`



For `STOP_LOSS` `SELL`, `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT` `SELL`, `TAKE_PROFIT` `BUY`, and `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` `BUY` orders:

  * `trailingDelta` >= `minTrailingBelowDelta`
  * `trailingDelta` <= `maxTrailingBelowDelta`



### Trailing Stop Order Scenarios[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/trailing-stop-faq#trailing-stop-order-scenarios "Direct link to Trailing Stop Order Scenarios")

#### Scenario A - Trailing Stop Loss Limit Buy Order[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/trailing-stop-faq#scenario-a---trailing-stop-loss-limit-buy-order "Direct link to Scenario A - Trailing Stop Loss Limit Buy Order")

At `12:01:00` there is a trade at a price of 40,000 and a `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT` order is placed on the `BUY` side of the exchange. The order has of a `stopPrice` of 44,000, a `trailingDelta` of 500 (5%), and a limit `price` of 45,000.

Between `12:01:00` and `12:02:00` a series of linear trades lead to a decrease in last price, ending at 37,000. This is a price decrease of 7.5% or 750 BIPS, well exceeding the order's `trailingDelta`. However since the order has not started price tracking, the price movement is ignored and the order remains contingent.

Between `12:02:00` and `12:03:00` a series of linear trades lead to an increase in last price. When a trade is equal to, or surpasses, the `stopPrice` the order starts tracking price changes immediately; the first trade that meets this condition sets the "lowest price". In this case, the lowest price is 44,000 and if there is a 500 BIPS increase from 44,000 then the order will trigger. The series of linear trades continue to increase the last price, ending at 45,000.

Between `12:03:00` and `12:04:00` a series of linear trades lead to an increase in last price, ending at 46,000. This is an increase of ~454 BIPS from the order's previously noted lowest price, but it's not large enough to trigger the order.

Between `12:04:00` and `12:05:00` a series of linear trades lead to a decrease in last price, ending at 42,000. This is a decrease from the order's previously noted lowest price. If there is a 500 BIPS increase from 42,000 then the order will trigger.

Between `12:05:00` and `12:05:30` a series of linear trades lead to an increase in last price to 44,100. This trade is equal to, or surpasses, the order's requirement of 500 BIPS, as `44,100 = 42,000 * 1.05`. This causes the order to trigger and start working against the order book at its limit price of 45,000.

#### Scenario B - Trailing Stop Loss Limit Sell Order[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/trailing-stop-faq#scenario-b---trailing-stop-loss-limit-sell-order "Direct link to Scenario B - Trailing Stop Loss Limit Sell Order")

At `12:01:00` there is a trade at a price of 40,000 and a `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT` order is placed on the `SELL` side of the exchange. The order has of a `stopPrice` of 39,000, a `trailingDelta` of 1000 (10%), and a limit `price` of 38,000.

Between `12:01:00` and `12:02:00` a series of linear trades lead to an increase in last price, ending at 41,500.

Between `12:02:00` and `12:03:00` a series of linear trades lead to a decrease in last price. When a trade is equal to, or surpasses, the `stopPrice` the order starts tracking price changes immediately; the first trade that meets this condition sets the "highest price". In this case, the highest price is 39,000 and if there is a 1000 BIPS decrease from 39,000 then the order will trigger.

Between `12:03:00` and `12:04:00` a series of linear trades lead to a decrease in last price, ending at 37,000. This is a decrease of ~512 BIPS from the order's previously noted highest price, but it's not large enough to trigger the order.

Between `12:04:00` and `12:05:00` a series of linear trades lead to an increase in last price, ending at 41,000. This is an increase from the order's previously noted highest price. If there is a 1000 BIPS decrease from 41,000 then the order will trigger.

Between `12:05:00` and `12:05:30` a series of linear trades lead to a decrease in last price to 36,900. This trade is equal to, or surpasses, the order's requirement of 1000 BIPS, as `36,900 = 41,000 * 0.90`. This causes the order to trigger and start working against the order book at its limit price of 38,000.

#### Scenario C - Trailing Take Profit Limit Buy Order[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/trailing-stop-faq#scenario-c---trailing-take-profit-limit-buy-order "Direct link to Scenario C - Trailing Take Profit Limit Buy Order")

At `12:01:00` there is a trade at a price of 40,000 and a `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` order is placed on the `BUY` side of the exchange. The order has of a `stopPrice` of 38,000, a `trailingDelta` of 850 (8.5%), and a limit `price` of 38,500.

Between `12:01:00` and `12:02:00` a series of linear trades lead to an increase in last price, ending at 42,000.

Between `12:02:00` and `12:03:00` a series of linear trades lead to a decrease in last price. When a trade is equal to, or surpasses, the `stopPrice` the order starts tracking price changes immediately; the first trade that meets this condition sets the "lowest price". In this case, the lowest price is 38,000 and if there is a 850 BIPS increase from 38,000 then the order will trigger.

The series of linear trades continues to decrease the last price, ending at 37,000. If there is a 850 BIPS increase from 37,000 then the order will trigger.

Between `12:03:00` and `12:04:00` a series of linear trades lead to an increase in last price, ending at 39,000. This is an increase of ~540 BIPS from the order's previously noted lowest price, but it's not large enough to trigger the order.

Between `12:04:00` and `12:05:00` a series of linear trades lead to a decrease in last price, ending at 38,000. It does not surpass the order's previously noted lowest price, resulting in no change to the order's trigger price.

Between `12:05:00` and `12:05:30` a series of linear trades lead to an increase in last price to 40,145. This trade is equal to, or surpasses, the order's requirement of 850 BIPS, as `40,145 = 37,000 * 1.085`. This causes the order to trigger and start working against the order book at its limit price of 38,500.

#### Scenario D - Trailing Take Profit Limit Sell Order[​](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/trailing-stop-faq#scenario-d---trailing-take-profit-limit-sell-order "Direct link to Scenario D - Trailing Take Profit Limit Sell Order")

At `12:01:00` there is a trade at a price of 40,000 and a `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` order is placed on the `SELL` side of the exchange. The order has of a `stopPrice` of 42,000, a `trailingDelta` of 750 (7.5%), and a limit `price` of 41,000.

Between `12:01:00` and `12:02:00` a series of linear trades lead to an increase in last price, ending at 41,500.

Between `12:02:00` and `12:03:00` a series of linear trades lead to a decrease in last price, ending at 39,000.

Between `12:03:00` and `12:04:00` a series of linear trades lead to an increase in last price. When a trade is equal to, or surpasses, the `stopPrice` the order starts tracking price changes immediately; the first trade that meets this condition sets the "highest price". In this case, the highest price is 42,000 and if there is a 750 BIPS decrease from 42,000 then the order will trigger.

The series of linear trades continues to increase the last price, ending at 45,000. If there is a 750 BIPS decrease from 45,000 then the order will trigger.

Between `12:04:00` and `12:05:00` a series of linear trades lead to a decrease in last price, ending at 44,000. This is a decrease of ~222 BIPS from the order's previously noted highest price, but it's not large enough to trigger the order.

Between `12:05:00` and `12:06:00` a series of linear trades lead to an increase in last price, ending at 46,500. This is an increase from the order's previously noted highest price. If there is a 750 BIPS decrease from 46,500 then the order will trigger.

Between `12:06:00` and `12:06:50` a series of linear trades lead to a decrease in last price to 43,012.5. This trade is equal to, or surpasses, the order's requirement of 750 BIPS, as `43,012.5 = 46,500 * 0.925`. This causes the order to trigger and start working against the order book at its limit price of 41,000.

At `12:01:00` there is a trade at a price of 40,000 and a `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT` order is placed on the `SELL` side of the exchange. The order has a `trailingDelta` of 700 (7%), a limit `price` of 39,000 and no `stopPrice`. The order starts tracking price changes once placed. If there is a 700 BIPS decrease from 40,000 then the order will trigger.

Between `12:01:00` and `12:02:00` a series of linear trades lead to an increase in last price, ending at 42,000. This is an increase from the order's previously noted highest price. If there is a 700 BIPS decrease from 42,000 then the order will trigger.

Between `12:02:00` and `12:03:00` a series of linear trades lead to a decrease in last price, ending at 39,500. This is a decrease of ~595 BIPS from the order's previously noted highest price, but it's not large enough to trigger the order.

Between `12:03:00` and `12:04:00` a series of linear trades lead to an increase in last price, ending at 45,500. This is an increase from the order's previously noted highest price. If there is a 700 BIPS decrease from 45,500 then the order will trigger.

Between `12:04:00` and `12:04:45` a series of linear trades lead to a decrease in last price to 42,315. This trade is equal to, or surpasses, the order's requirement of 700 BIPS, as `42,315 = 45,500 * 0.93`. This causes the order to trigger and start working against the order book at its limit price of 39,000.

# 追踪止盈止损(Trailing Stop)订单常见问题

### 什么是追踪止盈止损订单?[​](/docs/zh-CN/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/trailing-stop-faq#什么是追踪止盈止损订单 "什么是追踪止盈止损订单?的直接链接")

追踪止盈止损是一种用于追踪市场价格变动的工具. 现货的API中多了一个新参数 `trailingDelta`, 用来定义订单触发时机, 其值为基点(BIPS).

显然追踪止盈止损订单允许价格在有利的方向变动,同时限制在不利方向上的价格变动.

买单: _价格低_ 是有利的. 持续的价格 _下跌_ 是被允许的. 但是如果市场价格基于下单后的最低点 _上涨_ 了预定义的价格差, 订单会被触发.

卖单: _价格高_ 是有利的. 持续的价格 _上涨_ 是被允许的. 但是如果市场价格基于下单后的最高点 _下跌_ 了预定义的价格差, 订单会被触发.

### 什么是基点(BIPs)?[​](/docs/zh-CN/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/trailing-stop-faq#什么是基点bips "什么是基点\(BIPs\)?的直接链接")

基点,又称为bps或bips,是金融学中用来描述百分比变化.

基点数| 百分比| 小数形式  
---|---|---  
1| 0.01%| 0.0001  
10| 0.1%| 0.001  
100| 1%| 0.01  
1000| 10%| 0.1  
  
比如, 一个设置`trailingDelta=100`的止损(STOP_LOSS)卖单,则会构成一个追踪止损卖单, 此订单在提交后会跟踪价格变动,当价格从提交后的最高价下跌`1%`的时候会被触发为市价单卖掉.

### 什么样的订单可以成追踪止盈止损单?[​](/docs/zh-CN/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/trailing-stop-faq#什么样的订单可以成追踪止盈止损单 "什么样的订单可以成追踪止盈止损单?的直接链接")

`STOP_LOSS`, `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT`, `TAKE_PROFIT`, 和 `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` 支持追踪止盈止损功能.

限价止盈止损单订单(OCO)在其止盈止损单中支持追踪止盈止损功能. 如果追踪止盈止损被触发,其中的限价单(LIMIT)会被取消.

### 如果下追踪止盈止损订单?[​](/docs/zh-CN/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/trailing-stop-faq#如果下追踪止盈止损订单 "如果下追踪止盈止损订单?的直接链接")

追踪止盈止损订单的使用和`STOP_LOSS`, `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT`, `TAKE_PROFIT`, 或者 `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` 订单很类似,但是多了一个`trailingDelta`参数. 此参数必须在交易对的`TRAILING_DELTA`过滤器定义范围内. 具体值可以参见接口 `GET /api/v3/exchangeInfo`.

不同于一般的止盈止损单,追踪止盈止损订单中的`stopPrice`是可选的. 如果`stopPrice`被设置了,那么订单只有当这个`stopPrice`价格被触发了后,才开始追踪价格变动.如果`stopPrice`被忽略,则会立刻开始追踪价格变化.

### 什么样的价格变动会触发追踪止盈止损订单?[​](/docs/zh-CN/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/trailing-stop-faq#什么样的价格变动会触发追踪止盈止损订单 "什么样的价格变动会触发追踪止盈止损订单?的直接链接")

追踪的订单类型| 方向| 止盈止损价(Stop price)条件| 触发所需的价格变动  
---|---|---|---  
`TAKE_PROFIT`| 卖出| 市场价 >= 止盈价| 从最高价 _回调_  
`TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT`| 卖出| 市场价 >= 止盈价| 从最高价 _回调_  
`STOP_LOSS`| 卖出| 市场价 <= 止损价| 从最高价 _回调_  
`STOP_LOSS_LIMIT`| 卖出| 市场价 <= 止损价| 从最高价 _回调_  
`STOP_LOSS`| 买入| 市场价 >= 止损价| 从最低价 _上涨_  
`STOP_LOSS_LIMIT`| 买入| 市场价 >= 止损价| 从最低价 _上涨_  
`TAKE_PROFIT`| 买入| 市场价 <= 止盈价| 从最低价 _上涨_  
`TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT`| 买入| 市场价 <= 止盈价| 从最低价 _上涨_  
  
### 如果使用 `TRAILING_DELTA` 过滤器?[​](/docs/zh-CN/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/trailing-stop-faq#如果使用-trailing_delta-过滤器 "如果使用-trailing_delta-过滤器的直接链接")

对于 `STOP_LOSS` 买单, `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT` 买单, `TAKE_PROFIT` 卖单, 和 `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` 卖单:

  * `trailingDelta` >= `minTrailingAboveDelta`
  * `trailingDelta` <= `maxTrailingAboveDelta`



对于 `STOP_LOSS` 卖单, `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT` 卖单, `TAKE_PROFIT` 买单, 和 `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` 买单:

  * `trailingDelta` >= `minTrailingBelowDelta`
  * `trailingDelta` <= `maxTrailingBelowDelta`



### 追踪止盈止损订单用例[​](/docs/zh-CN/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/trailing-stop-faq#追踪止盈止损订单用例 "追踪止盈止损订单用例的直接链接")

#### 用例 A - 追踪止损限价买单[​](/docs/zh-CN/binance-spot-api-docs/faqs/trailing-stop-faq#用例-a---追踪止损限价买单 "用例 A - 追踪止损限价买单的直接链接")

在 `12:01:00` 的时候,市场最新价为40,000. 这时候有一个限价止损买单(`STOP_LOSS_LIMIT`)进入交易所, 并且设置了止损价(`stopPrice`)为44,000, `trailingDelta`为500 (5%), 以及限价(`LIMIT`) 45,000.

在 `12:01:00` 到 `12:02:00` 之间市场上一系列的交易让最新价下跌到37,000. 到这里价格下跌了7.5%(750 BIPS), 超过了设置价格差值(`trailingDelta`). 但是因为还没有开始追踪市场, 所以价格变动被忽略.

在 `12:02:00` 到 `12:03:00` 之间市场上一系列的交易让价格开始上涨. 当一个交易(trade)价格等于,或者超过了止损价(`stopPrice`)(44,000),这时候订单立刻开始追踪价格变动. 满足条件的第一个交易会被看作"最低价", 在这个例子里就是44,000. 如果价格从44,000上涨了500个基点, 订单就会被触发. 这时候市场持续交易, 并将最新价推高到45,000.

在 `12:03:00` 到 `12:04:00` 之间市场的交易让最新价上涨到46,000. 这时价格已经从之前标记的最低价(44,000)上涨了大约454个基点, 但是还不到触发订单的要求(500个基点).

在 `12:04:00` 到 `12:05:00` 之间市场上一系列的交易让最新价开始下跌到42,000. 这是从之前的标记的最低价开始的下跌, 最低价被标记为当前价(42,000). 如果市场从这里上涨500个基点, 订单会被触发.

在 `12:05:00` 到 `12:05:30` 之间市场交易让最新价上涨到44,100. 最新的交易价格到达或者超过了订单设置的500个基点要求(`44,100 = 42,000 * 1.05`). 这导致了订单被触发, 然后被以限价45,000的价格放到订单薄(order book)里面.

在 `12:01:00` 的时候, 市场最新价为40,000. 这时候有一个限价止损卖单(`STOP_LOSS_LIMIT`)进入交易所, 并且设置了止损价(`stopPrice`)为39,000, `trailingDelta`为1,000 (10%), 以及限价(LIMIT) 38,000.

在 `12:01:00` 到 `12:02:00` 之间市场上一系列的交易让最新价上涨到41,500.

在 `12:02:00` 到 `12:03:00` 之间市场的交易让价格开始下跌. 当一个交易(trade)价格等于, 或者低于了止损价(`stopPrice`)(39,000), 这时候订单立刻开始追踪价格变动. 满足条件的第一个交易会被看作"最高价", 在这个例子里就是39,000. 如果价格从39,000下跌了1,000个基点, 订单就会被触发.

在 `12:03:00` 到 `12:04:00` 之间市场上一系列的交易让最新价开始下跌到37,000. 这时价格已经从之前标记的最高价(39,000)回落了大约512个基点, 但是还不到触发订单的要求(1000个基点).

在 `12:04:00` 到 `12:05:00` 之间市场上一系列的交易让最新价开始上涨到41,000. 这是从之前的标记的最高价开始的上涨, 最高价被标记为当前价(41,000). 如果这时候有1000个基点下跌, 订单会被触发.

在 `12:05:00` 到 `12:05:30` 之间的一些市场交易让最新价下跌到36,900. 最新的交易价格到达或者超过了订单设置的1000个基点要求(`36,900 = 41,000 * 0.90`). 这导致了订单被触发, 然后被以限价38,000的价格放到订单薄(order book)里面.

在 `12:01:00` 的时候, 市场最新价为40,000. 这时候有一个限价止盈买单(`TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT`)进入交易所, 并且设置了止盈价(`stopPrice`)为38,000, `trailingDelta`为 850 (8.5%), 以及限价(LIMIT) 38,500.

在 `12:01:00` 到 `12:02:00` 之间市场上一系列的交易让最新价上涨到42,000.

在 `12:02:00` 到 `12:03:00` 之间市场交易让价格开始下跌. 当一个交易(trade)价格等于, 或者超过了止盈价(`stopPrice`)(38,000), 这时候订单立刻开始追踪价格变动. 满足条件的第一个交易会被看作"最低价", 在这个例子里就是38,000. 市场的持续交易,让最新价下跌到37,000. 这时最低价被设为37,000. 如果价格从37,000上涨了850个基点, 订单就会被触发.

在 `12:03:00` 到 `12:04:00` 之间市场上一系列的交易让最新价开始上涨到39,000. 这时价格已经从之前标记的最低价(37,000)上涨了大约540个基点, 但是还不到触发订单的要求(850个基点).

在 `12:04:00` 到 `12:05:00` 之间市场上一系列的交易让最新价开始下跌到38,000, 没有低于之前的最低价, 所以不会有任何变化.

在 `12:05:00` 到 `12:05:30` 之间的一些市场交易让最新价上涨到40,145. 最新的交易价格到达或者超过了订单设置的850个基点要求(`40,145 = 37,000 * 1.085`). 这导致了订单被触发, 然后被以限价38,500的价格放到订单薄(order book)里面.

在 `12:01:00` 的时候,市场最新价为40,000. 这时候有一个限价止盈卖单(`TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT`)进入交易所, 并且设置了止盈价(`stopPrice`)为42,000, `trailingDelta`为 750 (7.5%), 以及限价(LIMIT) 41,000.

在 `12:01:00` 到 `12:02:00` 之间市场上一系列的交易让最新价上涨到41,500.

在 `12:02:00` 到 `12:03:00` 之间市场上一系列的交易让价格开始下跌到39,000.

在 `12:03:00` 到 `12:04:00` 之间市场上一系列的交易让最新价开始上涨. 当最新的交易价格到达或者超过了订单设置的止盈价(`stopPrice`),订单就会立刻开始追踪. 第一个满足条件的交易价就被设为"最高价". 在这个例子中, 最高价是42,000. 如果从最高价下跌750个基点, 订单就会被触发.

这时市场价格持续上涨,最新价到了45,000. 追踪止盈订单的"最高价"也被设置成了45,000. 如果价格从这里下跌750个基点, 订单会被触发.

在 `12:04:00` 到 `12:05:00` 之间市场上一系列的交易让最新价开始下跌到44,000. 这相当于从之前的最高价(45,000)下跌了大约222个基点, 不过没有达到追踪止盈订单设置的750个基点要求, 所以不会触发.

在 `12:05:00` 到 `12:06:00` 之间的一些市场交易让最新价上涨到46,500. 因为市场上涨,之前的最高价被设置成当前价(46,500). 如果价格从这里下跌750个基点, 订单会被触发.

在 `12:06:00` 到 `12:06:50` 之间的一些市场交易让最新价下跌到43,012.5. 当前价格达到或者超过了追踪订单设定的750个基点(`43,012.5 = 46,500 * 0.925`), 导致订单被触发, 以限价(LIMIT)41,000的价格被放入订单薄.

在 `12:01:00` 的时候, 市场最新价为40,000. 这时候有一个限价止损卖单(`STOP_LOSS_LIMIT`)进入交易所, 并且设置了`trailingDelta`为 700 (7%), 以及限价(LIMIT) 39,000, 但是没有设置限价(`stopPrice`). 订单创建后就开始追踪价格. 如果价格从40,000下跌了700个基点, 订单就会被触发.

在 `12:01:00` 到 `12:02:00` 之间市场上一系列的交易让价格开始上涨到42,000, 使追踪的"最高价"变成42,000. 如果价格从这里(42,000)开始下跌700个基点, 订单会被触发.

在 `12:02:00` 到 `12:03:00` 之间市场上一系列的交易让价格下跌到39,500, 这让市场从之前追踪的最高价（42,000)下跌了大约595个基点, 不过没有达到700个基点的要求, 订单不会被触发.

在 `12:03:00` 到 `12:04:00` 之间市场上一系列的交易让价格上涨到45,500. 市场的上涨, 让追踪的最高价变成当前价45,500. 如果价格从这里45,500下跌了700个基点, 订单就会被触发.

在 `12:04:00` 到 `12:04:45` 之间市场上一系列的交易让价格下跌到42,315. 当前价格达到或者超过了追踪订单设定的700个基点(`42,315 = 45,500 * 0.93`), 导致订单被触发, 以限价(LIMIT)39,000的价格被放入订单薄.
