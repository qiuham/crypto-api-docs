When the total liability for each crypto set as collateral exceeds a certain percentage of the platform's total limit, the auto-conversion mechanism may be triggered. This may result in the automatic sale of excess collateral crypto if you've set this crypto as collateral and have large borrowings. To lower this risk, consider reducing your use of the crypto as collateral or reducing your liabilities.

>> collateralRestrict | Boolean | ~~Platform level collateralized borrow restriction  
`true`  
`false`~~(deprecated, use colRes instead)  
>> collateralEnabled | Boolean | `true`: Collateral enabled  
`false`: Collateral disabled  
Applicable to `Multi-currency margin`  
"" will be returned for inapplicable fields under the current account level.    
\- The account data is sent on event basis and regular basis.   
\- The event push is not pushed in real-time. It is aggregated and pushed at a fixed time interval, around 50ms. For example, if multiple events occur within a fixed time interval, the system will aggregate them into a single message and push it at the end of the fixed time interval. If the data volume is too large, it may be split into multiple messages.   
\- The regular push sends updates regardless of whether there are activities in the trading account or not.    
\- Only currencies with non-zero balance will be pushed. Definition of non-zero balance: any value of eq, availEq, availBql parameters is not 0. If the data is too large to be sent in a single push message, it will be split into multiple messages.   
\- For example, when subscribing to account channel without specifying ccy and there are 5 currencies are with non-zero balance, all 5 currencies data will be pushed in initial snapshot and in regular update. Subsequently when there is change in balance or equity of an token, only the incremental data of that currency will be pushed triggered by this change. 

### Positions channel

Retrieve position information. Initial snapshot will be pushed according to subscription granularity. Data will be pushed when triggered by events such as placing/canceling order, and will also be pushed in regular interval according to subscription granularity.  

Concurrent connection to this channel will be restricted by the following rules: [WebSocket connection count limit](/docs-v5/en/#overview-websocket-connection-count-limit).

\- The position data is sent on event basis and regular basis   
\- The event push is not pushed in real-time. It is aggregated and pushed at a fixed time interval, around 50ms. For example, if multiple events occur within a fixed time interval, the system will aggregate them into a single message and push it at the end of the fixed time interval. If the data volume is too large, it may be split into multiple messages.   
\- The regular push sends updates regardless of whether there are position activities or not.   
\- If an event push and a regular push happen at the same time, the system will send the event push first, followed by the regular push.  As for portfolio margin account, the IMR and MMR of the position are calculated in risk unit granularity, thus their values of the same risk unit cross positions are the same.  In the position-by-position trading setting, it is an autonomous transfer mode. After the margin is transferred, positions with a position of 0 will be pushed    
\- Only position with non-zero position quantity will be pushed. Definition of non-zero quantity: value of pos parameter is not 0. If the data is too large to be sent in a single push message, it will be split into multiple messages.   
\- For example, when subscribing to positions channel specifying an underlying and there are 20 positions are with non-zero quantity, all 20 positions data will be pushed in initial snapshot and in regular push. Subsequently when there is change in pos of a position, only the data of that position will be pushed triggered by this change.  Unlike futures contracts, option positions are automatically exercised or expire at maturity. The rights then terminate and no closing orders are generated. Therefore, this channel will not push any updates for expired option positions. 

### Balance and position channel

Retrieve account balance and position information. Data will be pushed when triggered by events such as filled order, funding transfer.  
This channel applies to getting the account cash balance and the change of position asset ASAP.   
Concurrent connection to this channel will be restricted by the following rules: [WebSocket connection count limit](/docs-v5/en/#overview-websocket-connection-count-limit).

### Position risk warning

This push channel is only used as a risk warning, and is not recommended as a risk judgment for strategic trading   
In the case that the market is volatile, there may be the possibility that the position has been liquidated at the same time that this message is pushed.  
The warning is sent when a position is at risk of liquidation for isolated margin positions. The warning is sent when all the positions are at risk of liquidation for cross-margin positions.  
Concurrent connection to this channel will be restricted by the following rules: [WebSocket connection count limit](/docs-v5/en/#overview-websocket-connection-count-limit).

#### Push data parameters

**Parameters** | **Types** | **Description**  
---|---|---  
arg | Object | Successfully subscribed channel  
> channel | String | Channel name  
> uid | String | User Identifier  
data | Array of objects | Subscribed data  
> deltaBS | String | delta: Black-Scholes Greeks in dollars  
> deltaPA | String | delta: Greeks in coins  
> gammaBS | String | gamma: Black-Scholes Greeks in dollars, only applicable to OPTION cross  
> gammaPA | String | gamma: Greeks in coins, only applicable to OPTION cross  
> thetaBS | String | theta: Black-Scholes Greeks in dollars, only applicable to OPTION cross  
> thetaPA | String | theta: Greeks in coins, only applicable to OPTION cross  
> vegaBS | String | vega: Black-Scholes Greeks in dollars, only applicable to OPTION cross  
> vegaPA | String | vega: Greeks in coins, only applicable to OPTION cross  
> ccy | String | Currency  
> ts | String | Push time of account greeks, Unix timestamp format in milliseconds, e.g. 1597026383085  
The account greeks data is sent on event basis and regular basis   
\- The event push is not pushed in real-time. It is aggregated and pushed at a fixed time interval, around 50ms. For example, if multiple events occur within a fixed time interval, the system will aggregate them into a single message and push it at the end of the fixed time interval. If the data volume is too large, it may be split into multiple messages.   
\- When the user specifies a settlement currency in the subscribe request, event push will only be triggered when the position of the same settlement currency changes. For example, when subscribe `ccy`=BTC, if the position of `BTC-USDT-SWAP` changes, no event push will be triggered.   
\- The regular push sends updates regardless of whether there are activities or not.    
\- Only currencies in the account will be pushed. If the data is too large to be sent in a single push message, it will be split into multiple messages.   
\- For example, when subscribing to account-greeks channel without specifying ccy and there are 5 currencies are with non-zero balance, all 5 currencies data will be pushed in initial snapshot and in regular interval. Subsequently when there is change in balance or equity of an token, only the incremental data of that currency will be pushed triggered by this change.

\- 账户频道基于事件推送，并进行定时推送   
\- 账户频道的事件推送并非在事件发生时实时进行，而是按照大约50毫秒的固定时间窗口进行聚合推送。例如，在固定时间窗口内发生多个事件，系统将尽量聚合为一条消息并在固定时间窗口结束时进行推送。在数据量过大的情况下可能拆分为多条消息。   
\- 无论是否有账户维度的变化，定时推送都会发送更新    
\- 只推用户币种层面资产不为0的账户信息。币种层面资产不为0的定义：eq、availEq、availBal 中任意一个字段不为0，即币种层面资产不为0。如果数据太大无法在单个推送消息中发送，它将被分成多个消息发送。   
\- 例：按照所有币种订阅且有5个币种的余额或者权益都不为0，首次和定时推全部5个；账户下有一个币种余额或者权益改变，那么账户变更的触发只推这一个。 

### 持仓频道 

获取持仓信息，首次订阅按照订阅维度推送数据，此外，当下单、撤单等事件触发时，推送数据以及按照订阅维度定时推送数据  
该频道的并发连接受到如下规则限制：[WebSocket 连接限制](/docs-v5/zh/#overview-websocket-connection-count-limit)

\- 持仓频道基于事件推送，并进行定时推送。   
\- 持仓频道的事件推送并非在事件发生时实时进行，而是按照大约50毫秒的固定时间窗口进行聚合推送。例如，在固定时间窗口内发生多个事件，系统将尽量聚合为一条消息并在固定时间窗口结束时进行推送。在数据量过大的情况下可能拆分为多条消息。   
\- 无论是否有仓位的变化，定时推送都会发送更新。   
\- 若事件推送和定时推送同时发生，系统将在发送一次事件推送消息后再发送一次定时推送消息。  Portfolio Margin 账户下，持仓的 IMR MMR的数据是后端服务以ristUnit为最小粒度重新计算，相同riskUnit全仓仓位的imr和mmr返回值相同。  逐仓交易设置里是自主划转模式，转入保证金后会推送持仓量为0的仓位。    
\- 只推用户持有的仓位。用户持仓仓位定义：持逐仓自主划转模式下的逐仓仓位pos=0，pos>0或者pos<0都认为持有仓位。如果数据太大无法在单个推送消息中发送，它将被分成多个消息发送。   
\- 例：按underlying订阅且该underlying下有20个持仓，首次和定时推全部20个；持仓下有一个成交改变其中的一个持仓，那么持仓变更只推这一个。  与交割合约不同，期权持仓到期之后，期权持仓在到期后会自动行权或作废，持仓本身随即消失，因此，该频道不会推送期权到期的信息。 

### 账户余额和持仓频道 

获取账户余额和持仓信息，首次订阅按照订阅维度推送数据，此外，当成交、资金划转等事件触发时，推送数据。  

该频道适用于尽快获取账户现金余额和仓位资产变化的信息。  
该频道的并发连接受到如下规则限制：[WebSocket 连接限制](/docs-v5/zh/#overview-websocket-connection-count-limit)

### 爆仓风险预警推送频道 

此推送频道仅作为风险提示，不建议作为策略交易的风险判断。  
在行情剧烈波动的情况下，可能会出现此消息推送的同时仓位已经被强平的可能性。  
预警会在某一个逐仓仓位有风险时推送。预警会在所有全仓仓位有风险时推送。

账户greeks频道基于事件推送，并进行定时推送  
\- greeks频道的事件推送并非在事件发生时实时进行，而是按照大约50毫秒的固定时间窗口进行聚合推送。例如，在固定时间窗口内发生多个事件，系统将尽量聚合为一条消息并在固定时间窗口结束时进行推送。在数据量过大的情况下可能拆分为多条消息。   
\- 当用户订阅时指定了保证金币种(ccy)，只有作为保证金的仓位发生变化的时候，才会触发事件推送。例如订阅时指定了ccy=`BTC`，如果`BTC-USDT-SWAP`仓位发生变化，不会触发事件推送。   
\- 无论是否有greeks数据的变化，定时推送都会发送更新。    
\- 只推账户资产不为0的greeks数据。如果数据太大无法在单个推送消息中发送，它将被分成多个消息发送。   
\- 例：按照所有币种订阅且有5个币种资产都不为0，首次和定时推全部5个；账户的某个币种资产改变，那么账户greeks变更的触发只推这一个。
