When the total liability for each crypto set as collateral exceeds a certain percentage of the platform's total limit, the auto-conversion mechanism may be triggered. This may result in the automatic sale of excess collateral crypto if you've set this crypto as collateral and have large borrowings. To lower this risk, consider reducing your use of the crypto as collateral or reducing your liabilities.  
Refer to [Introduction to the platform collateralized borrowing limit](https://www.okx.com/help/introduction-to-the-platforms-collateralized-borrowing-limit-mechanism) for more details.  
>> collateralRestrict | Boolean | ~~Platform level collateralized borrow restriction  
`true`  
`false`~~(deprecated, use colRes instead)  
>> collateralEnabled | Boolean | `true`: Collateral enabled  
`false`: Collateral disabled  
Applicable to `Multi-currency margin`  
"" will be returned for inapplicable fields under the current account level.    
\- The account data is sent on event basis and regular basis.   
\- The event push is not pushed in real-time. It is aggregated and pushed at a fixed time interval, around 50ms. For example, if multiple events occur within a fixed time interval, the system will aggregate them into a single message and push it at the end of the fixed time interval. If the data volume is too large, it may be split into multiple messages.   
\- The regular push sends updates regardless of whether there are activities in the trading account or not.    
\- Only currencies with non-zero balance will be pushed. Definition of non-zero balance: any value of eq, availEq, availBql parameters is not 0. If the data is too large to be sent in a single push message, it will be split into multiple messages.   
\- For example, when subscribing to account channel without specifying ccy and there are 5 currencies are with non-zero balance, all 5 currencies data will be pushed in initial snapshot and in regular update. Subsequently when there is change in balance or equity of an token, only the incremental data of that currency will be pushed triggered by this change.

\- 账户频道基于事件推送，并进行定时推送   
\- 账户频道的事件推送并非在事件发生时实时进行，而是按照大约50毫秒的固定时间窗口进行聚合推送。例如，在固定时间窗口内发生多个事件，系统将尽量聚合为一条消息并在固定时间窗口结束时进行推送。在数据量过大的情况下可能拆分为多条消息。   
\- 无论是否有账户维度的变化，定时推送都会发送更新    
\- 只推用户币种层面资产不为0的账户信息。币种层面资产不为0的定义：eq、availEq、availBal 中任意一个字段不为0，即币种层面资产不为0。如果数据太大无法在单个推送消息中发送，它将被分成多个消息发送。   
\- 例：按照所有币种订阅且有5个币种的余额或者权益都不为0，首次和定时推全部5个；账户下有一个币种余额或者权益改变，那么账户变更的触发只推这一个。
