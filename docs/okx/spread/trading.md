# Spread Trading

👉 The Spread Orderbook product enables users to **post or consume liquidity** on spreads for **large sizes** that are guaranteed **atomic execution**. Benefits include simplified futures rolls, funding arbitrage, yield enhancement, and speculation on basis and term structures.   
  
## Introduction

### Basic Concepts

  1. **Spread -** Entering a trade where the trader is long one instrument and short an offsetting quantity of a related instrument, forming a trade with two risk offsetting legs.
  2. **Order-book -** A collection of offers to trade an instrument or basket. Each offer contains a defined instrument or group of instruments, relevant quantity, and the price at which the offerer is willing to transact. Takers can then immediately consume these offers up to the full amount of quantity listed at the offered price. The pending order limit of spread trading is 500 across all spreads.

### High Level Workflow

Nitro Spreads is centered around the familiar concept of a Central Limit Order Book (**CLOB**).

  * Spreads consist of instruments sourced from OKX where they are cleared and settled.
  * Anyone can act as a "Taker," who consumes an existing resting order, or a "Maker," whose order is consumed.
  * Trades take place when orders are crossed. Trades are then sent for clearing and settlement on OKX.

At a high level, the Nitro Spreads workflow is as follows:

  1. _Maker_ rests a Limit Order upon a Spread's Order Book.
  2. _Taker_ consumes a resting Order via a Limit Order.
  3. The crossed orders are sent for clearing and settlement.
  4. The _Taker_ and _Maker_ receive confirmation of the success or rejection of the Trade.
  5. All users are notified of successfully settled & cleared Trades, minus the counterparties or sides (`buy` / `sell`) involved.

Key aspects of Nitro Spreads:

  * All Spreads have **publicly accessible** Central Limit Order Books **(CLOB)**.
  * The availability of trading Spreads is determined by OKX. Typically, these Spreads encompass all possible combinations of delta one derivatives (Expiry Futures and Perpetual Futures) and SPOT within a specific instrument family (e.g. "BTC/USDT" or "ETH/USDC").
  * **Partial fills** and multiple orders can be consumed as part of a single trade.
  * **Counterparties** are **NOT** selected. All Spread Order Books can be engaged by anyone, effectively trading against the broader market.
  * Anonymity is maintained throughout the process, with all orders and trades conducted on an **anonymous basis**.
  * Users have the flexibility to place multiple orders on both the bid and ask sides of the Order Book, allowing for a **ladder-style** configuration.

## Comprehensive API Workflow

Notifications regarding Orders and Trades will be received by both the Taker and the Maker through the WebSocket Notification channels. 

A user assumes the role of a _Maker_ when their Order is executed upon by another Order. A user becomes a _Taker_ when they submit an Order that crosses an existing Order in the Order Book.

### Obtaining Available Spreads

To retrieve all available Spreads for trading on OKX, make a request to the `GET /api/v5/sprd/spreads` endpoint.

### Retrieving Your Orders

To retrieve orders on OKX, make a request to the `GET /api/v5/sprd/order` endpoint.

### Retrieving Your Trades

To retrieve trades on OKX, make a request to the `GET /api/v5/sprd/trades` endpoint.

### Submitting an Order

To submit an order to a Spread's Order Book, make a request to the `POST /api/v5/sprd/order` endpoint.

### Spread States

There are three different states during a Spread's life cycle: `live`, `suspend`, and `expired` as detailed below:

  1. `live`: Spreads that are actively traded on Nitro Spreads
  2. `suspend`: Spreads in which at least one of the legs is suspended and the other one is active or suspended on the OKX orderbook exchange; or spreads in which the underlying instruments are still live on the OKX orderbook exchange, but removed from Nitro Spreads
  3. `expired`: Spreads in which at least one of the underlying instruments is expired on the OKX orderbook exchange

Please refer to the following table for all possible scenarios given the state of the underlying instruments and the resulting state of the spread on Nitro Spreads (except for the case that the spread is delisted on Nitro Spreads):

Instrument A | Instrument B | Spread State  
---|---|---  
Live | Live | Live  
Suspend | Live | Suspend  
Live | Suspend | Suspend  
Suspend | Suspend | Suspend  
Expired | Live | Expired  
Live | Expired | Expired  
Suspend | Expired | Expired  
Expired | Suspend | Expired  
Expired | Expired | Expired  
  
### Trade Lifecycle

In order for a trade to take place, two orders must be crossed within a Spread's Order Book.

Obtain information about the state of an Order and determine if it has reached its final state by monitoring the `sprd-orders`WebSocket channel. The `state` key in the channel indicates the current state of the Order. If the state is `live` or `partially_filled`, it means that the Order still has available size (`sz`) that the creator or another user can take action on. On the other hand, if the state is `canceled` or `filled`, the Order no longer has any available actions that the creator or any other user can take action on.

It is important to closely track the values of the following attributes: `sz`(size),`pendingFillSz` (pending fill size), `canceledSz` (canceled size), and `accFillSz`(accumulated fill size). These attributes provide crucial information regarding the status and progression of the Order.

### Order State

Track the state of an order by subscribing to the `sprd-orders` WebSocket channel.

  1. Upon submitting an order, whether as a Maker or Taker, an order update message is sent via the orders WebSocket channel. The message will indicate the order's `state` == `live`.
  2. Order matching and trade settlement are asynchronous processes. When the order is matched but not settled, system pushes `pendingSettleSz` > 0 and `fillSz` == ""
  3. If the order is partially filled, an order update message is sent with `state` == `partially_filled`.
  4. In the event that the order is completely filled, an order update message is sent with the `state` == `filled`.
  5. If the order is not fully filled but has reached its final state, an order update message is sent with the `state` == `canceled`.
  6. If a certain part of an order is rejected, an order update message is sent with updated `canceledSz` and `pendingFillSz`, and `code` and `msg` corresponding to the error.

### Trade State

Track the state of a trade by subscribing to the `sprd-trades`WebSocket channel.

  1. After an executed trade undergoes clearing and settlement on OKX, it reaches finality.
  2. For successfully cleared trades, a WebSocket message is sent with the `state`denoted as `filled`.
  3. In the case of an unsuccessful trade clearing, a trade update message is sent with the `state` reflected as `rejected`.
  4. If the trade state is `rejected`, the trade update message will also include the error `code` and a corresponding error message (`msg`) that explains the reason for the rejection.

### All Trades

All users have the ability to receive updates on all trades that take place through the OKX Nitro Spreads product.

It's important to note that OKX Nitro Spreads does not disclose information about the counterparties involved in the trades or the individual `side` (`buy` or `sell`) of the composite legs that were traded.

  1. By subscribing to the `sprd-public-trades`WebSocket channel, WebSocket messages are sent exclusively for trades that have been successfully cleared and settled.

newSz  
If the new quantity of the order is less than or equal to the (accFillSz + canceledSz + pendingSettleSz), after pendingSettleSz is settled, the order status will be transitioned into filled (if canceledSz = 0), or canceled (if canceledSz > 0).  The amend order returns sCode equal to 0  
It is not strictly considered that the order has been amended. It only means that your amend order request has been accepted by the system server. The result of the amend is subject to the status pushed by the order channel or the order status query.

## WebSocket Public Channel

  * Production Trading URL: `wss://ws.okx.com:8443/ws/v5/business`
  * Demo Trading URL: `wss://wspap.okx.com:8443/ws/v5/business`

### Order book channel

Retrieve order book data. Available channels:

  * `sprd-bbo-tbt`: 1 depth level snapshot will be pushed in the initial push. Snapshot data will be pushed every 10 ms when there are changes in the 1 depth level snapshot.
  * `sprd-books5`: 5 depth levels snapshot will be pushed in the initial push. Snapshot data will be pushed every 100 ms when there are changes in the 5 depth levels snapshot.
  * `sprd-books-l2-tbt`: 400 depth levels will be pushed in the initial full snapshot. Incremental data will be pushed every 10 ms for the changes in the order book during that period of time. 
  * The push sequence for order book channels within the same connection and trading symbols is fixed as: sprd-bbo-tbt -> sprd-books-l2-tbt -> sprd-books5.

#### Push data parameters

Parameter | Type | Description  
---|---|---  
arg | Object | Successfully subscribed channel  
> channel | String | Channel name  
> sprdId | String | spread ID  
action | String | Push data action, incremental data or full snapshot.  
`snapshot`: full  
`update`: incremental  
data | Array of objects | Subscribed data  
> asks | Array of strings | Order book on sell side  
> bids | Array of strings | Order book on buy side  
> ts | String | Order book generation time, Unix timestamp format in milliseconds, e.g. 1597026383085  
> checksum | Integer | Checksum, implementation details below. Only applicable to `sprd-books-l2-tbt`.  
> prevSeqId | Integer | Sequence ID of the last sent message. Only applicable to `sprd-books-l2-tbt`.  
> seqId | Integer | Sequence ID of the current message, implementation details below.  
An example of the array of asks and bids values: ["411.8", "10", "4"]  
\- "411.8" is the depth price  
\- "10" is the quantity at the price (Unit: szCcy)  
\- "4" is the number of orders at the price.  

#### Sequence ID

`seqId` is the sequence ID of the market data published. The set of sequence ID received by users is the same if users are connecting to the same channel through multiple websocket connections. Each `sprdId` has an unique set of sequence ID. Users can use `prevSeqId` and `seqId` to build the message sequencing for incremental order book updates. Generally the value of seqId is larger than prevSeqId. The `prevSeqId` in the new message matches with `seqId` of the previous message. The smallest possible sequence ID value is 0, except in snapshot messages where the prevSeqId is always -1.  

Exceptions:  
1\. If there are no updates to the depth for an extended period, OKX will send a message with `'asks': [], 'bids': []` to inform users that the connection is still active. `seqId` is the same as the last sent message and `prevSeqId` equals to `seqId`. 2\. The sequence number may be reset due to maintenance, and in this case, users will receive an incremental message with `seqId` smaller than `prevSeqId`. However, subsequent messages will follow the regular sequencing rule.

##### Example

  1. Snapshot message: prevSeqId = -1, seqId = 10
  2. Incremental message 1 (normal update): prevSeqId = 10, seqId = 15
  3. Incremental message 2 (no update): prevSeqId = 15, seqId = 15
  4. Incremental message 3 (sequence reset): prevSeqId = 15, seqId = 3
  5. Incremental message 4 (normal update): prevSeqId = 3, seqId = 5

#### Checksum

This mechanism can assist users in checking the accuracy of depth data.

##### Merging incremental data into full data

After subscribing to the incremental load push (such as `books` 400 levels) of Order Book Channel, users first receive the initial full load of market depth. After the incremental load is subsequently received, update the local full load.

  1. If there is the same price, compare the size. If the size is 0, delete this depth data. If the size changes, replace the original data.
  2. If there is no same price, sort by price (bid in descending order, ask in ascending order), and insert the depth information into the full load.

##### Calculate Checksum

Use the first 25 bids and asks in the full load to form a string (where a colon connects the price and size in an ask or a bid), and then calculate the CRC32 value (32-bit signed integer).

### Public Trades channel

Retrieve the recent trades data from `sprd-public-trades`. Data will be pushed whenever there is a trade. Every update contains only one trade.

# 价差交易

👉 Spread Orderbook 产品使用户能够灵活交易大尺寸价差（Spread），可以用于简化交割合約展期、资金费套利和提高收益率，以及基于基差和期限结构的投机。   
  
## 介绍 

### 基本概念 

  1. 价差（**Spread） -** 做多一种产品并同时做空数量等价的另一种相关产品，形成具有两条风险互相抵消的腿的交易
  2. 订单簿（**Order-book） -** 一种或一组交易产品的报价集合。每个报价都包含一个或一组定义的产品、相关数量以及 _Maker_(报价者)愿意交易的价格。然后， _Taker_(接受者)可以立即消耗这些报价，直至订单簿上列出的全部数量。价差交易挂单限额为所有价差挂单合计不超过500个。

### 基本工作流程 

Nitro Spreads 以熟悉的**中央限价订单簿 (CLOB)** 概念为中心：

  * Spreads里包含的产品来自OKX交易所，交易之后也在OKX交易所进行清算和结算。
  * 任何人都可以充当“Taker”，消耗现有的剩余订单，或“Maker”，其订单被消耗。
  * 交易在订单被匹配时发生，之后它们被发送到 OKX 进行清算和结算。

简单来说，Nitro Spreads 工作流程是

  1. _Maker 在 Spread 的订单簿上设置限价订单。_
  2. _Taker通过限价单消耗一个resting Order。_
  3. 被匹配的订单被发送去清算和结算。
  4. Taker和Maker收到交易成功或拒绝的确认
  5. 所有用户都会收到成功结算和清算交易的通知，除去涉及的交易双方以交易方向 (买入或卖出) 等信息。

Nitro Spreads 的主要方面：

  * 所有价差都有**可公开访问** 的中央限价订单簿 (**CLOB**)。
  * Spreads的可用性由OKX决定。通常，这些Spreads包括同一标的下（如“BTC/USDT”或“ETH/USDC”）中 delta one 衍生品（交割和永续）和现货的所有可能组合。
  * **部分成交** 和多个订单可以作为单笔交易的一部分。
  * 交易对手方**不是** 任由用户选择的。任何人都可以参与所有Spread的订单簿，有效地与更广泛的市场进行交易。
  * 整个过程保持匿名，所有订单和交易均在**匿名** 的基础上进行。
  * 用户可以灵活地在订单簿的买卖双方下多个订单，从而实现阶梯式配置。

## 全面的 API 工作流程 

有关订单和交易的通知将由 *Taker* 和 *Maker* 通过 WebSocket 通知渠道接收。 

当用户的订单被另一个订单执行时，用户将承担 _Maker_ 的角色。当用户提交的订单与订单簿中的现有订单相匹配时，他们就会成为 _Taker_

### 获取可用Spreads 

要检索在 OKX 上交易的所有可用Spreads，您应该向 `GET /api/v5/sprd/spreads` 发出请求

### 检索您的订单

要在 OKX 上检索您的订单，您应该向 `GET /api/v5/sprd/order` 发出请求。

### 检索您的交易

要检索您在 OKX 上的交易，您应该向 `GET /api/v5/sprd/trades` 发出请求。

### 提交订单 

要向 某个Spread 的订单簿提交订单，您应该请求 `POST /api/v5/sprd/order` 。

### Spread状态 

Spread 的生命周期中存在三种不同的状态：`live`，`suspend`，和 `expired`:

  1. `live`: 在 Nitro Spread 上活跃交易的Spreads
  2. `suspend`：其中至少一条腿被暂停，另一条在 OKX 订单簿交易所处于活跃或暂停状态的价差；或标的工具仍在 OKX 订单簿交易所中存在但已从 Nitro Spread 中移除的Spread
  3. `expired`：至少一条腿在 OKX 订单簿交易所到期的Spread

给定每条腿的状态以及 Nitro Spreads 上的Spread状态（除了在 Nitro Spread上退市的情况），所有可能Spread状态的情况请参考下表：

交易产品A | 交易产品B | Spread状态  
---|---|---  
Live | Live | Live  
Suspend | Live | Suspend  
Live | Suspend | Suspend  
Suspend | Suspend | Suspend  
Expired | Live | Expired  
Live | Expired | Expired  
Suspend | Expired | Expired  
Expired | Suspend | Expired  
Expired | Expired | Expired  
  
### 交易生命周期 

为了进行交易，需要在价差撮合交易中匹配两个订单。 通过订阅 `sprd-orders`WebSocket 通道，您可以获得有关订单状态的信息并确定它是否已达到最终状态。通道中的`state`值表示订单的当前状态。

  1. 如果状态为`live` 或 `partially_filled`，则意味着订单仍有未达最终状态（`filled`或`canceled`）数量，创建者或其他用户仍可能可以对其执行操作。
  2. 另一方面，如果状态为`canceled`或`filled`，创建者或任何其他用户将无法对此订单执行任何操作。

请密切跟踪以下属性：`sz`（数量）、`pendingFillSz`（待完成数量）、`canceledSz`（被取消数量）和 `accFillSz`（累积完成数量）。这些属性提供了有关订单状态和进展的重要信息。

### 用户的订单状态 

通过订阅 `sprd-orders`WebSocket 频道，用户可以跟踪他们的订单状态。

  1. 提交订单后，无论是 _Maker_ 还是 _Taker_ ，用户都会通过订单 WebSocket 频道道收到订单更新消息。该消息将指示订单的`state` == `live`。
  2. 订单成交和结算是异步的。当订单已成交但还没结算，用户将收到`pendingSettleSz`>0，`fillSz` == ""的订单更新消息
  3. 如果订单已部分成交且仍有待处理数量，用户将收到`state` == `partially_filled` 的订单更新消息
  4. 如果订单完全成交，用户将收到`state` == `filled`的订单更新消息
  5. 如果订单未完全消耗，但已达到最终状态，用户将收到`state` == `canceled`的订单更新消息。
  6. 如果订单的某个部分被拒绝，用户会收到更新的订单更新，其中包含更新的 `canceledSz` 和 `pendingFillSz`，以及与错误对应的`code`和`msg`。

### 用户的交易状态 

通过订阅 `sprd-trades`WebSocket 频道，用户可以跟踪他们的交易状态。 1\. 一笔已执行的交易在OKX上进行清算结算后，即为最终交易。 2\. 对于成功清算的交易，用户会收到一条 WebSocket 消息，其中的`state`表示`filled`。 3\. 在交易清算不成功的情况下，用户会收到一条交易更新消息，`state`反映为`rejected`。 4\. 如果交易`state`为`rejected`，交易更新消息还将包含错误代码`code`和解释拒绝原因的相应错误消息 `msg`。

### 所有交易 

所有用户都能够接收通过 OKX Nitro Spread 产品发生的所有交易的更新。 请务必注意，OKX Nitro Spreads 不会披露有关交易双方及交易方向（买入或卖出）的信息。

  1. 用户可以订阅`sprd-public-trades`频道来获取所有已成功结算的交易。

#### 推送数据参数

参数名 | 类型 | 描述  
---|---|---  
arg | Object | 订阅成功的频道  
> channel | String | 频道名  
> sprdId | String | Spread ID  
action | String | 推送数据动作，增量推送数据还是全量推送数据  
`snapshot`：全量  
`update`：增量  
data | Array of objects | 订阅的数据  
> asks | Array of strings | 卖方深度  
> bids | Array of strings | 买方深度  
> ts | String | 数据更新时间戳，Unix时间戳的毫秒数格式，如 1597026383085  
> checksum | Integer | 检验和 （下方注解）。仅适用 `sprd-books-l2-tbt`  
> prevSeqId | Integer | 上一个推送的序列号。仅适用 `sprd-books-l2-tbt`  
> seqId | Integer | 推送的序列号 （下方注解）  
asks和bids值数组举例说明： ["411.8", "10", "4"]   
\- 411.8为深度价格   
\- 10为此价格的数量 （单位为szCcy)   
\- 4为此价格的订单数量   

#### 序列号

`seqId`是交易所行情的一个序号。如果用户通过多个websocket连接同一频道，收到的序列号会是相同的。每个`sprdId`对应一套。用户可以使用在增量推送频道的`prevSeqId`和`seqId`来构建消息序列。这将允许用户检测数据包丢失和消息的排序。正常场景下`seqId`的值大于`prevSeqId`。新消息中的`prevSeqId`与上一条消息的`seqId`匹配。最小序列号值为0，除了快照消息的`prevSeqId`为-1。  

异常情况：  
1\. 如果一段时间内没有深度更新，OKX将发一条消息`'asks': [], 'bids': []`以通知用户连接是正常的。推送的`seqId`跟上一条信息的一样，`prevSeqId`等于`seqId`。 2\. 序列号可能由于维护而重置，在这种情况下，用户将收到一条`seqId`小于`prevSeqId`的增量消息。随后的消息将遵循常规的排序规则。

##### 示例

  1. 快照推送：`prevSeqId = -1`，`seqId = 10`
  2. 增量推送1（正常更新）：`prevSeqId = 10`，`seqId = 15`
  3. 增量推送2（无更新）：`prevSeqId = 15`，`seqId = 15`
  4. 增量推送3（序列重置）：`prevSeqId = 15`，`seqId = 3`
  5. 增量推送4（正常更新）：`prevSeqId = 3`，`seqId = 5`

#### Checksum机制

此机制可以帮助用户校验深度数据的准确性。

##### 深度合并

用户订阅增量推送深度频道成功后，首先获取初始全量深度数据，当获取到增量推送数据后，更新本地全量深度数据。 

  1. 如果有相同价格，则比较数量；数量为0删除此深度，数量有变化则替换此数据。
  2. 如果没有相同价格，则按照价格优劣排序（bid为价格降序，ask为价格升序），将深度信息插入到全量数据中

##### 计算校验和

先用深度合并后前25档bids和asks组成一个字符串（其中ask和bid中的价格和数量以冒号连接），再计算其crc32值（32位有符号整型）。 

### 公共成交数据频道 

订阅`sprd-public-trades`获取最近的成交数据，有成交数据就推送，每次推送仅包含一条成交数据。
