# High Level Workflow

Nitro Spreads is centered around the familiar concept of a Central Limit Order Book (**CLOB**).

  * Spreads consist of instruments sourced from OKX where they are cleared and settled.
  * Anyone can act as a "Taker," who consumes an existing resting order, or a "Maker," whose order is consumed.
  * Trades take place when orders are crossed. Trades are then sent for clearing and settlement on OKX.

At a high level, the Nitro Spreads workflow is as follows:

  1. _Maker_ rests a Limit Order upon a Spread's Order Book.
  2. _Taker_ consumes a resting Order via a Limit Order.
  3. The crossed orders are sent for clearing and settlement.
  4. The _Taker_ and _Maker_ receive confirmation of the success or rejection of the Trade.
  5. All users are notified of successfully settled & cleared Trades, minus the counterparties or sides (`buy` / `sell`) involved.

Key aspects of Nitro Spreads:

  * All Spreads have **publicly accessible** Central Limit Order Books **(CLOB)**.
  * The availability of trading Spreads is determined by OKX. Typically, these Spreads encompass all possible combinations of delta one derivatives (Expiry Futures and Perpetual Futures) and SPOT within a specific instrument family (e.g. "BTC/USDT" or "ETH/USDC").
  * **Partial fills** and multiple orders can be consumed as part of a single trade.
  * **Counterparties** are **NOT** selected. All Spread Order Books can be engaged by anyone, effectively trading against the broader market.
  * Anonymity is maintained throughout the process, with all orders and trades conducted on an **anonymous basis**.
  * Users have the flexibility to place multiple orders on both the bid and ask sides of the Order Book, allowing for a **ladder-style** configuration.

# 基本工作流程

Nitro Spreads 以熟悉的**中央限价订单簿 (CLOB)** 概念为中心：

  * Spreads里包含的产品来自OKX交易所，交易之后也在OKX交易所进行清算和结算。
  * 任何人都可以充当“Taker”，消耗现有的剩余订单，或“Maker”，其订单被消耗。
  * 交易在订单被匹配时发生，之后它们被发送到 OKX 进行清算和结算。

简单来说，Nitro Spreads 工作流程是

  1. _Maker 在 Spread 的订单簿上设置限价订单。_
  2. _Taker通过限价单消耗一个resting Order。_
  3. 被匹配的订单被发送去清算和结算。
  4. Taker和Maker收到交易成功或拒绝的确认
  5. 所有用户都会收到成功结算和清算交易的通知，除去涉及的交易双方以交易方向 (买入或卖出) 等信息。

Nitro Spreads 的主要方面：

  * 所有价差都有**可公开访问** 的中央限价订单簿 (**CLOB**)。
  * Spreads的可用性由OKX决定。通常，这些Spreads包括同一标的下（如“BTC/USDT”或“ETH/USDC”）中 delta one 衍生品（交割和永续）和现货的所有可能组合。
  * **部分成交** 和多个订单可以作为单笔交易的一部分。
  * 交易对手方**不是** 任由用户选择的。任何人都可以参与所有Spread的订单簿，有效地与更广泛的市场进行交易。
  * 整个过程保持匿名，所有订单和交易均在**匿名** 的基础上进行。
  * 用户可以灵活地在订单簿的买卖双方下多个订单，从而实现阶梯式配置。
