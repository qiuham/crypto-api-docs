limit: Limit order, which requires specified sz and px.  
post_only: Post-only order, which the order can only provide liquidity to the market and be a maker. If the order would have executed on placement, it will be canceled instead. ioc: Immediate-or-cancel order  sz   
The sz unit for inverse spreads is USD in Nitro Spread, as opposed to contract in OKX orderbook.
