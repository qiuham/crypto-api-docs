## API key Creation

Please refer to [my api page](/account/my-api) regarding API Key creation.

### Generating an API key

Create an API key on the website before signing any requests. After creating an API key, keep the following information safe:

  * API key
  * Secret key
  * Passphrase

The system returns randomly-generated API keys and SecretKeys. You will need to provide the Passphrase to access the API. We store the salted hash of your Passphrase for authentication. We cannot recover the Passphrase if you have lost it. You will need to create a new set of API key.  
  

### API key permissions

There are three permissions below that can be associated with an API key. One or more permission can be assigned to any key.  

  * `Read` : Can request and view account info such as bills and order history which need read permission
  * `Trade` : Can place and cancel orders, funding transfer, make settings which need write permission
  * `Withdraw` : Can make withdrawals

### API key security

To improve security, we strongly recommend clients linked the API key to IP addresses  

  * Each API key can bind up to 20 IP addresses, which support IPv4/IPv6 and network segment formats.   

API keys that are not linked to an IP address and have `trade` or `withdraw` permissions will expire after 14 days of inactivity. (The API key of demo trading will not expire)   

  * Only when the user calls an API that requires API key authentication will it be considered as the API key is used.
  * Calling an API that does not require API key authentication will not be considered used even if API key information is passed in.
  * For websocket, only operation of logging in will be considered to have used the API key. Any operation though the connection after logging in (such as subscribing/placing an order) will not be considered to have used the API key. Please pay attention.

Users can get the usage records of the API key with `trade` or `withdraw` permissions but unlinked to any IP address though [Security Center](/account/security).

## REST Authentication

### Making Requests

All private REST requests must contain the following headers:

  * `OK-ACCESS-KEY` The API key as a String.

  * `OK-ACCESS-SIGN` The Base64-encoded signature (see Signing Messages subsection for details).

  * `OK-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP` The UTC timestamp of your request .e.g : 2020-12-08T09:08:57.715Z

  * `OK-ACCESS-PASSPHRASE` The passphrase you specified when creating the API key.

Request bodies should have content type `application/json` and be in valid JSON format.

### Signature

> Signing Messages

The `OK-ACCESS-SIGN` header is generated as follows:

  * Create a pre-hash string of timestamp + method + requestPath + body (where + represents String concatenation).
  * Prepare the SecretKey.
  * Sign the pre-hash string with the SecretKey using the HMAC SHA256.
  * Encode the signature in the Base64 format.

Example: `sign=CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(timestamp + 'GET' + '/api/v5/account/balance?ccy=BTC', SecretKey))`

The `timestamp` value is the same as the `OK-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP` header with millisecond ISO format, e.g. `2020-12-08T09:08:57.715Z`.

The request method should be in UPPERCASE: e.g. `GET` and `POST`.

The `requestPath` is the path of requesting an endpoint.

Example: `/api/v5/account/balance`

The `body` refers to the String of the request body. It can be omitted if there is no request body (frequently the case for `GET` requests).

Example: `{"instId":"BTC-USDT","lever":"5","mgnMode":"isolated"}`

`GET` request parameters are counted as requestpath, not body 

The SecretKey is generated when you create an API key.

Example: `22582BD0CFF14C41EDBF1AB98506286D`

## WebSocket

### Overview

WebSocket is a new HTML5 protocol that achieves full-duplex data transmission between the client and server, allowing data to be transferred effectively in both directions. A connection between the client and server can be established with just one handshake. The server will then be able to push data to the client according to preset rules. Its advantages include:

  * The WebSocket request header size for data transmission between client and server is only 2 bytes.
  * Either the client or server can initiate data transmission.
  * There's no need to repeatedly create and delete TCP connections, saving resources on bandwidth and server.

We recommend developers use WebSocket API to retrieve market data and order book depth. 

### Connect

**Connection limit** : 3 requests per second (based on IP)

When subscribing to a public channel, use the address of the public service. When subscribing to a private channel, use the address of the private service

**Request limit** : 

The total number of 'subscribe'/'unsubscribe'/'login' requests per connection is limited to 480 times per hour.

If there’s a network problem, the system will automatically disable the connection. 

The connection will break automatically if the subscription is not established or data has not been pushed for more than 30 seconds. 

To keep the connection stable: 

1\. Set a timer of N seconds whenever a response message is received, where N is less than 30. 

2\. If the timer is triggered, which means that no new message is received within N seconds, send the String 'ping'. 

3\. Expect a 'pong' as a response. If the response message is not received within N seconds, please raise an error or reconnect. 

### Connection count limit

The limit will be set at 30 WebSocket connections per specific WebSocket channel per sub-account. Each WebSocket connection is identified by the unique `connId`.

  

The WebSocket channels subject to this limitation are as follows:

  1. [Orders channel](/docs-v5/en/#order-book-trading-trade-ws-order-channel)
  2. [Account channel](/docs-v5/en/#trading-account-websocket-account-channel)
  3. [Positions channel](/docs-v5/en/#trading-account-websocket-positions-channel)
  4. [Balance and positions channel](/docs-v5/en/#trading-account-websocket-balance-and-position-channel)
  5. [Position risk warning channel](/docs-v5/en/#trading-account-websocket-position-risk-warning)
  6. [Account greeks channel](/docs-v5/en/#trading-account-websocket-account-greeks-channel)

If users subscribe to the same channel through the same WebSocket connection through multiple arguments, for example, by using `{"channel": "orders", "instType": "ANY"}` and `{"channel": "orders", "instType": "SWAP"}`, it will be counted once only. If users subscribe to the listed channels (such as orders and accounts) using either the same or different connections, it will not affect the counting, as these are considered as two different channels. The system calculates the number of WebSocket connections per channel.

  

The platform will send the number of active connections to clients through the `channel-conn-count` event message **to new channel subscriptions**.

> Connection count update
    
    
    {
        "event":"channel-conn-count",
        "channel":"orders",
        "connCount": "2",
        "connId":"abcd1234"
    }
    
    

  

When the limit is breached, generally the latest connection that sends the subscription request will be rejected. Client will receive the usual subscription acknowledgement followed by the `channel-conn-count-error` from the connection that the subscription has been terminated. In exceptional circumstances the platform may unsubscribe existing connections.

> Connection limit error
    
    
    {
        "event": "channel-conn-count-error",
        "channel": "orders",
        "connCount": "30",
        "connId":"a4d3ae55"
    }
    
    

  

Order operations through WebSocket, including place, amend and cancel orders, are not impacted through this change.

      "event": "error",
      "code": "60009",
      "msg": "Login failed.",
      "connId": "a4d3ae55"
    }
    

#### Response parameters

Parameter | Type | Required | Description  
---|---|---|---  
event | String | Yes | Operation  
`login`  
`error`  
code | String | No | Error code  
msg | String | No | Error message  
connId | String | Yes | WebSocket connection ID  
  
**apiKey** : Unique identification for invoking API. Requires user to apply one manually.

**passphrase** : API Key password

**timestamp** : the Unix Epoch time, the unit is seconds, e.g. 1704876947

**sign** : signature string, the signature algorithm is as follows:

First concatenate `timestamp`, `method`, `requestPath`, strings, then use HMAC SHA256 method to encrypt the concatenated string with SecretKey, and then perform Base64 encoding.

**secretKey** : The security key generated when the user applies for API key, e.g. `22582BD0CFF14C41EDBF1AB98506286D`

**Example of timestamp** : const timestamp = '' + Date.now() / 1,000

**Among sign example** : sign=CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(timestamp +'GET'+'/users/self/verify', secretKey))

**method** : always 'GET'.

**requestPath** : always '/users/self/verify'

The request will expire 30 seconds after the timestamp. If your server time differs from the API server time, we recommended using the REST API to query the API server time and then set the timestamp.

### Notification

WebSocket has introduced a new message type (event = `notice`).   
  

Client will receive the information in the following scenarios:

  * Websocket disconnect for service upgrade  

60 seconds prior to the upgrade of the WebSocket service, the notification message will be sent to users indicating that the connection will soon be disconnected. Users are encouraged to establish a new connection to prevent any disruptions caused by disconnection.

> Response Example
    
    
    {
        "event": "notice",
        "code": "64008",
        "msg": "The connection will soon be closed for a service upgrade. Please reconnect.",
        "connId": "a4d3ae55"
    }
    

  
  
The feature is supported by WebSocket Public (/ws/v5/public) and Private (/ws/v5/private) for now.

## Account mode

To facilitate your trading experience, please set the appropriate account mode before starting trading.

In the trading account trading system, 4 account modes are supported: `Spot mode`, `Futures mode`, `Multi-currency margin mode`, and `Portfolio margin mode`.

You need to set on the Web/App for the first set of every account mode.

## General Info

**The rules for placing orders at the exchange level are as follows:**

  * The maximum number of pending orders (including post only orders, limit orders and taker orders that are being processed): 4,000 
  * The maximum number of pending orders per trading symbol is 500, the limit of 500 pending orders applies to the following **order types** : 

    * Limit
    * Market
    * Post only
    * Fill or Kill (FOK)
    * Immediate or Cancel (IOC)
    * Market order with Immediate-or-Cancel order (optimal limit IOC)
    * Take Profit / Stop Loss (TP/SL)
    * Limit and market orders triggered under the order types below: 
      * Take Profit / Stop Loss (TP/SL)
      * Trigger
      * Trailing stop
      * Arbitrage
      * Iceberg
      * TWAP

**The rules for trading are as follows:**

  * When the number of maker orders matched with a taker order exceeds the maximum number limit of 1000, the taker order will be canceled. 
    * The limit orders will only be executed with a portion corresponding to 1000 maker orders and the remainder will be canceled.
    * Fill or Kill (FOK) orders will be canceled directly.

  

**The rules for the returning data are as follows:**

  * `code` and `msg` represent the request result or error reason when the return data has `code`, and has not `sCode`;

  * It is `sCode` and `sMsg` that represent the request result or error reason when the return data has `sCode` rather than `code` and `msg`.

  

**`instFamily` and `uly` parameter explanation:**

  * The following explanation is based on the `BTC` contract, other contracts are similar.
  * `uly` is the index, like "BTC-USD", and there is a one-to-many relationship with the settlement and margin currency (`settleCcy`).
  * `instFamily` is the trading instrument family, like `BTC-USD_UM`, and there is a one-to-one relationship with the settlement and margin currency (`settleCcy`).
  * The following table shows the corresponding relationship of `uly`, `instFamily`, `settleCcy` and `instId`.

**Contract Type** | **uly** | **instFamily** | **settleCcy** | **Delivery contract instId** | **Swap contract instId**  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
USDT-margined contract | BTC-USDT | BTC-USDT | USDT | BTC-USDT-250808 | BTC-USDT-SWAP  
USDC-margined contract | BTC-USDC | BTC-USDC | USDC | BTC-USDC-250808 | BTC-USDC-SWAP  
USD-margined contract | BTC-USD | **BTC-USD_UM** | **USDⓈ** | **BTC-USD_UM-250808** | **BTC-USD_UM-SWAP**  
Coin-margined contract | BTC-USD | **BTC-USD** | **BTC** | **BTC-USD-250808** | **BTC-USD-SWAP**  
  
Note:  
1\. USDⓈ represents USD and multiple USD stable coins, like USDC, USDG.  
2\. The settlement and margin currency refers to the `settleCcy` field returned by the [Get instruments](/docs-v5/en/#trading-account-rest-api-get-instruments) endpoint.

## Transaction Timeouts

Orders may not be processed in time due to network delay or busy OKX servers. You can configure the expiry time of the request using `expTime` if you want the order request to be discarded after a specific time.

If `expTime` is specified in the requests for Place (multiple) orders or Amend (multiple) orders, the request will not be processed if the current system time of the server is after the `expTime`.

### REST API

## Rate Limits

Our REST and WebSocket APIs use rate limits to protect our APIs against malicious usage so our trading platform can operate reliably and fairly.  
When a request is rejected by our system due to rate limits, the system returns error code 50011 (Rate limit reached. Please refer to API documentation and throttle requests accordingly).  
The rate limit is different for each endpoint. You can find the limit for each endpoint from the endpoint details. Rate limit definitions are detailed below:

  * WebSocket login and subscription rate limits are based on connection.

  * Public unauthenticated REST rate limits are based on IP address.

  * Private REST rate limits are based on User ID (sub-accounts have individual User IDs).

  * WebSocket order management rate limits are based on User ID (sub-accounts have individual User IDs).

### Trading-related APIs

For Trading-related APIs (place order, cancel order, and amend order) the following conditions apply:

  * Rate limits are shared across the REST and WebSocket channels. 

  * Rate limits for placing orders, amending orders, and cancelling orders are independent from each other. 

  * Rate limits are defined on the Instrument ID level (except Options)

  * Rate limits for Options are defined based on the Instrument Family level. Refer to the [Get instruments](/docs-v5/en/#public-data-rest-api-get-instruments) endpoint to view Instrument Family information.

  * Rate limits for a multiple order endpoint and a single order endpoint are also independent, with the exception being when there is only one order sent to a multiple order endpoint, the order will be counted as a single order and adopt the single order rate limit. 

### Sub-account rate limit

At the sub-account level, we allow a maximum of 1000 order requests per 2 seconds. Only new order requests and amendment order requests will be counted towards this limit. The limit encompasses all requests from the endpoints below. For batch order requests consisting of multiple orders, each order will be counted individually. Error code 50061 is returned when the sub-account rate limit is exceeded. The existing rate limit rule per instrument ID remains unchanged and the existing rate limit and sub-account rate limit will operate in parallel. If clients require a higher rate limit, clients can trade via multiple sub-accounts.

### Fill ratio based sub-account rate limit

This is only applicable to >= VIP5 customers.   
As an incentive for more efficient trading, the exchange will offer a higher sub-account rate limit to clients with a high trade fill ratio.   
  
The exchange calculates two ratios based on the transaction data from the past 7 days at 00:00 UTC.

  1. Sub-account fill ratio: This ratio is determined by dividing (the trade volume in USDT of the sub-account) by (sum of (new and amendment request count per symbol * symbol multiplier) of the sub-account). Note that the master trading account itself is also considered as a sub-account in this context.
  2. Master account aggregated fill ratio: This ratio is calculated by dividing (the trade volume in USDT on the master account level) by (the sum (new and amendment count per symbol * symbol multiplier] of all sub-accounts).

  

The symbol multiplier allows for fine-tuning the weight of each symbol. A smaller symbol multiplier (<1) is used for smaller pairs that require more updates per trading volume. All instruments have a default symbol multiplier, and some instruments will have overridden symbol multipliers.

InstType | Override rule | Overridden symbol multiplier | Default symbol multiplier  
---|---|---|---  
Perpetual Futures | Per instrument ID | `1`   
Instrument ID:   
BTC-USDT-SWAP   
BTC-USD-SWAP   
ETH-USDT-SWAP   
ETH-USD-SWAP | `0.2`  
Expiry Futures | Per instrument Family | `0.3`   
Instrument Family:   
BTC-USDT   
BTC-USD   
ETH-USDT   
ETH-USD | `0.1`  
Spot | Per instrument ID | `0.5`   
Instrument ID:   
BTC-USDT   
ETH-USDT | `0.1`  
Options | Per instrument Family |  | `0.1`  
  
The fill ratio computation excludes block trading, spread trading, MMP and fiat orders for order count; and excludes block trading, spread trading for trade volume. Only successful order requests (sCode=0) are considered.

  
  

At 08:00 UTC, the system will use the maximum value between the sub-account fill ratio and the master account aggregated fill ratio based on the data snapshot at 00:00 UTC to determine the sub-account rate limit based on the table below. For broker (non-disclosed) clients, the system considers the sub-account fill ratio only.

| Fill ratio[x<=ratio<y) | Sub-account rate limit per 2 seconds(new and amendment)  
---|---|---  
Tier 1 | [0,1) | 1,000  
Tier 2 | [1,2) | 1,250  
Tier 3 | [2,3) | 1,500  
Tier 4 | [3,5) | 1,750  
Tier 5 | [5,10) | 2,000  
Tier 6 | [10,20) | 2,500  
Tier 7 | [20,50) | 3,000  
Tier 8 | >= 50 | 10,000  
  
If there is an improvement in the fill ratio and rate limit to be uplifted, the uplift will take effect immediately at 08:00 UTC. However, if the fill ratio decreases and the rate limit needs to be lowered, a one-day grace period will be granted, and the lowered rate limit will only be implemented on T+1 at 08:00 UTC. On T+1, if the fill ratio improves, the higher rate limit will be applied accordingly. In the event of client demotion to VIP4, their rate limit will be downgraded to Tier 1, accompanied by a one-day grace period.

  

If the 7-day trading volume of a sub-account is less than 1,000,000 USDT, the fill ratio of the master account will be applied to it.

  

For newly created sub-accounts, the Tier 1 rate limit will be applied at creation until T+1 8am UTC, at which the normal rules will be applied.

  

Block trading, spread trading, MMP and spot/margin orders are exempted from the sub-account rate limit.

  

The exchange offers [GET / Account rate limit](/docs-v5/en/#order-book-trading-trade-get-account-rate-limit) endpoint that provides ratio and rate limit data, which will be updated daily at 8am UTC. It will return the sub-account fill ratio, the master account aggregated fill ratio, current sub-account rate limit and sub-account rate limit on T+1 (applicable if the rate limit is going to be demoted).   
  
The fill ratio and rate limit calculation example is shown below. Client has 3 accounts, symbol multiplier for BTC-USDT-SWAP = 1 and XRP-USDT = 0.1.

  1. Account A (master account): 
     1. BTC-USDT-SWAP trade volume = 100 USDT, order count = 10;
     2. XRP-USDT trade volume = 20 USDT, order count = 15;
     3. Sub-account ratio = (100+20) / (10 * 1 + 15 * 0.1) = 10.4
  2. Account B (sub-account): 
     1. BTC-USDT-SWAP trade volume = 200 USDT, order count = 100;
     2. XRP-USDT trade volume = 20 USDT, order count = 30;
     3. Sub-account ratio = (200+20) / (100 * 1 + 30 * 0.1) = 2.13
  3. Account C (sub-account): 
     1. BTC-USDT-SWAP trade volume = 300 USDT, order count = 1000;
     2. XRP-USDT trade volume = 20 USDT, order count = 45;
     3. Sub-account ratio = (300+20) / (100 * 1 + 45 * 0.1) = 3.06
  4. Master account aggregated fill ratio = (100+20+200+20+300+20) / (10 * 1 + 15 * 0.1 + 100 * 1 + 30 * 0.1 + 100 * 1 + 45 * 0.1) = 3.01
  5. Rate limit of accounts 
     1. Account A = max(10.4, 3.01) = 10.4 -> 2500 order requests/2s
     2. Account B = max(2.13, 3.01) = 3.01 -> 1750 order requests/2s
     3. Account C = max(3.06, 3.01) = 3.06 -> 1750 order requests/2s

### Best practices

If you require a higher request rate than our rate limit, you can set up different sub-accounts to batch request rate limits. We recommend this method for throttling or spacing out requests in order to maximize each accounts' rate limit and avoid disconnections or rejections.

## 创建我的APIKey 

点击跳转至官网创建V5APIKey的页面 [创建我的APIKey](/account/my-api)  

### 生成APIKey 

在对任何请求进行签名之前，您必须通过交易网站创建一个APIKey。创建APIKey后，您将获得3个必须记住的信息：

  * APIKey
  * SecretKey
  * Passphrase

APIKey和SecretKey将由平台随机生成和提供，Passphrase将由您提供以确保API访问的安全性。平台将存储Passphrase加密后的哈希值进行验证，但如果您忘记Passphrase，则无法恢复，请您通过交易网站重新生成新的APIKey。  
  

### APIKey 权限 

APIKey 有如下3种权限，一个 APIKey 可以有一个或多个权限。

  * 读取 ：查询账单和历史记录等 读权限
  * 提现 ：可以进行提币
  * 交易 ：可以下单和撤单，转账，调整配置 等写权限

### APIKey 安全性 

为了提高安全性，我们建议您将 APIKey 绑定 IP  

  * 每个APIKey最多可绑定20个IP地址，IP地址支持IPv4/IPv6和网段的格式。   

未绑定IP且拥有交易或提币权限的APIKey，将在闲置14天之后自动删除。(模拟盘的 API key 不会被删除)  

  * 用户调用了需要 APIKey 鉴权的接口，才会被视为 APIKey 被使用。
  * 调用了不需要 APIKey 鉴权的接口，即使传入了 APIKey的信息，也不会被视为使用过。
  * Websocket 只有在登陆的时候，才会被视为 APIKey 被使用过。在登陆后的连接中做任何操作（如 订阅/下单），也不会被认为 APIKey 被使用，这点需要注意。

用户可以在 [安全中心](/zh-hans/account/security) 中看到未绑定IP且拥有交易/提现权限的 APIKey 最近使用记录。

## REST 请求验证 

### 发起请求 

所有REST私有请求头都必须包含以下内容：

  * `OK-ACCESS-KEY`字符串类型的APIKey。

  * `OK-ACCESS-SIGN`使用HMAC SHA256哈希函数获得哈希值，再使用Base-64编码（请参阅签名）。

  * `OK-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP`发起请求的时间（UTC），如：2020-12-08T09:08:57.715Z

  * `OK-ACCESS-PASSPHRASE`您在创建API密钥时指定的Passphrase。

所有请求都应该含有application/json类型内容，并且是有效的JSON。

### 签名 

> 生成签名

`OK-ACCESS-SIGN`的请求头是对`timestamp + method + requestPath + body`字符串（+表示字符串连接），以及SecretKey，使用HMAC SHA256方法加密，通过Base-64编码输出而得到的。

如：`sign=CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(timestamp + 'GET' + '/api/v5/account/balance?ccy=BTC', SecretKey))`

其中，`timestamp`的值与`OK-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP`请求头相同，为ISO格式，如`2020-12-08T09:08:57.715Z`。

method是请求方法，字母全部大写：`GET/POST`。

requestPath是请求接口路径。如：`/api/v5/account/balance`

body是指请求主体的字符串，如果请求没有主体（通常为GET请求）则body可省略。如：`{"instId":"BTC-USDT","lever":"5","mgnMode":"isolated"}`

GET请求参数是算作requestPath，不算body 

SecretKey为用户申请APIKey时所生成。如：`22582BD0CFF14C41EDBF1AB98506286D`

## WebSocket 

### 概述 

WebSocket是HTML5一种新的协议（Protocol）。它实现了用户端与服务器全双工通信， 使得数据可以快速地双向传播。通过一次简单的握手就可以建立用户端和服务器连接， 服务器根据业务规则可以主动推送信息给用户端。其优点如下：

  * 用户端和服务器进行数据传输时，请求头信息比较小，大概2个字节。
  * 用户端和服务器皆可以主动地发送数据给对方。
  * 不需要多次创建TCP请求和销毁，节约宽带和服务器的资源。

强烈建议开发者使用WebSocket API获取市场行情和买卖深度等信息。 

### 连接 

**连接限制** ：3 次/秒 (基于IP)

当订阅公有频道时，使用公有服务的地址；当订阅私有频道时，使用私有服务的地址

**请求限制** ：

每个连接 对于 `订阅`/`取消订阅`/`登录` 请求的总次数限制为 480 次/小时

如果出现网络问题，系统会自动断开连接

如果连接成功后30s未订阅或订阅后30s内服务器未向用户推送数据，系统会自动断开连接

为了保持连接有效且稳定，建议您进行以下操作：

1\. 每次接收到消息后，用户设置一个定时器，定时N秒，N 小于30。

2\. 如果定时器被触发（N 秒内没有收到新消息），发送字符串 'ping'。

3\. 期待一个文字字符串'pong'作为回应。如果在 N秒内未收到，请发出错误或重新连接。

### 连接限制 

子账户维度，订阅每个 WebSocket 频道的最大连接数为 30 个。每个 WebSocket 连接都由唯一的 connId 标识。

  

受此限制的 WebSocket 频道如下：

  1. [订单频道](/docs-v5/zh/#order-book-trading-trade-ws-order-channel)
  2. [账户频道](/docs-v5/zh/#trading-account-websocket-account-channel)
  3. [持仓频道](/docs-v5/zh/#trading-account-websocket-positions-channel)
  4. [账户余额和持仓频道](/docs-v5/zh/#trading-account-websocket-balance-and-position-channel)
  5. [爆仓风险预警推送频道](/docs-v5/zh/#trading-account-websocket-position-risk-warning)
  6. [账户greeks频道](/docs-v5/zh/#trading-account-websocket-account-greeks-channel)

若用户通过不同的请求参数在同一个 WebSocket 连接下订阅同一个频道，如使用 `{"channel": "orders", "instType": "ANY"}` 和 `{"channel": "orders", "instType": "SWAP"}`，只算为一次连接。若用户使用相同或不同的 WebSocket 连接订阅上述频道，如订单频道和账户频道。在该两个频道之间，计数不会累计，因为它们被视作不同的频道。简言之，系统计算每个频道对应的 WebSocket 连接数量。

  

新链接订阅频道时，平台将对该订阅返回`channel-conn-count`的消息同步链接数量。

> 链接数量更新
    
    
    {
        "event":"channel-conn-count",
        "channel":"orders",
        "connCount": "2",
        "connId":"abcd1234"
    }
    
    

  

当超出限制时，一般最新订阅的链接会收到拒绝。用户会先收到平时的订阅成功信息然后收到`channel-conn-count-error`消息，代表平台终止了这个链接的订阅。在异常场景下平台会终止已订阅的现有链接。

> 链接数量限制报错
    
    
    {
        "event": "channel-conn-count-error",
        "channel": "orders",
        "connCount": "30",
        "connId":"a4d3ae55"
    }
    
    

  

通过 WebSocket 进行的订单操作，例如下单、修改和取消订单，不会受到此改动影响。

**apiKey** :调用API的唯一标识。需要用户手动设置一个 **passphrase** :APIKey的密码 **timestamp** :Unix Epoch 时间戳，单位为秒，如 1704876947 **sign** :签名字符串，签名算法如下：

先将`timestamp` 、 `method` 、`requestPath` 进行字符串拼接，再使用HMAC SHA256方法将拼接后的字符串和SecretKey加密，然后进行Base64编码

**SecretKey:** 用户申请APIKey时所生成的安全密钥，如：22582BD0CFF14C41EDBF1AB98506286D

**其中 timestamp 示例** :const timestamp = '' + Date.now() / 1,000

**其中 sign 示例** : sign=CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(timestamp +'GET'+ '/users/self/verify', secret))

**method** 总是 'GET'

**requestPath** 总是 '/users/self/verify'

请求在时间戳之后30秒会失效，如果您的服务器时间和API服务器时间有偏差，推荐使用 REST API查询API服务器的时间，然后设置时间戳

### 通知 

WebSocket有一种消息类型(event=`notice`)。   
  

用户会在如下场景收到此类信息：

  * Websocket服务升级断线

在推送服务升级前60秒会推送信息，告知用户WebSocket服务即将升级。用户可以重新建立新的连接避免由于断线造成的影响。

## 交易时效性 

由于网络延时或者OKX服务器繁忙会导致订单无法及时处理。如果您对交易时效性有较高的要求，可以灵活设置请求有效截止时间`expTime`以达到你的要求。

（批量）下单，（批量）改单接口请求中如果包含`expTime`，如果服务器当前系统时间超过`expTime`，则该请求不会被服务器处理。

### REST API 

请求头中设置如下参数

    }
    

## 限速 

我们的 REST 和 WebSocket API 使用限速来保护我们的 API 免受恶意使用，因此我们的交易平台可以可靠和公平地运行。  
当请求因限速而被我们的系统拒绝时，系统会返回错误代码 50011（用户请求频率过快，超过该接口允许的限额。请参考 API 文档并限制请求）。  
每个接口的限速都不同。 您可以从接口详细信息中找到每个接口的限制。 限速定义详述如下：

  * WebSocket 登录和订阅限速基于连接。

  * 公共未经身份验证的 REST 限速基于 IP 地址。

  * 私有 REST 限速基于 User ID（子帐户具有单独的 User ID）。

  * WebSocket 订单管理限速基于 User ID（子账户具有单独的 User ID）。

### 交易相关API 

对于与交易相关的 API（下订单、取消订单和修改订单），以下条件适用：

  * 限速在 REST 和 WebSocket 通道之间共享。

  * 下单、修改订单、取消订单的限速相互独立。

  * 限速在 Instrument ID 级别定义（期权除外）

  * 期权的限速是根据 Instrument Family 级别定义的。 请参阅 [获取交易产品基础信息](/docs-v5/zh/#public-data-rest-api-get-instruments) 接口以查看交易品种信息。

  * 批量订单接口和单订单接口的限速也是独立的，除了只有一个订单发送到批量订单接口时，该订单将被视为一个订单并采用单订单限速。

### 子账户限速 

子账户维度，每2秒最多允许1000个订单相关请求。仅有新订单及修改订单请求会被计入此限制。此限制涵盖以下所列的所有接口。对于包含多个订单的批量请求，每个订单将被单独计数。如果请求频率超过限制，系统会返回50061错误码。产品ID维度的限速规则保持不变，现有的限速规则与新增的子账户维度限速将并行运行。若用户需要更高的速率限制，可以通过多个子账户进行交易。

  * [POST / 下单](/docs-v5/zh/#order-book-trading-trade-post-place-order)
  * [POST / 批量下单](/docs-v5/zh/#order-book-trading-trade-post-place-multiple-orders)
  * [POST / 修改订单](/docs-v5/zh/#order-book-trading-trade-post-amend-order)
  * [POST / 批量修改订单](/docs-v5/zh/#order-book-trading-trade-post-amend-multiple-orders)

  * [WS / 下单](/docs-v5/zh/#order-book-trading-trade-ws-place-order)

  * [WS / 批量下单](/docs-v5/zh/#order-book-trading-trade-ws-place-multiple-orders)

  * [WS / 改单](/docs-v5/zh/#order-book-trading-trade-ws-amend-order)

  * [WS / 批量改单](/docs-v5/zh/#order-book-trading-trade-ws-amend-multiple-orders)

### 基于成交比率的子账户限速 

仅适用于用户等级 >= VIP5的用户。   
为了激励更高效的交易，交易所将为交易成交比率高的用户提供更高的子账户限速。

交易所将在每天 00:00 UTC，根据过去七天的交易数据计算两个比率。

  1. 子账户成交比率：该比率为（子账户的USDT对应交易量）/（每个交易产品的新增和修改请求数 * 交易产品乘数之和）。请注意，在这种情况下，母账户自身也被视为一个“子账户”。
  2. 母账户合计成交比率：该比率为（母账户层面的USDT对应交易量）/（所有子账户各个交易产品的新增和修改请求数 * 交易产品乘数之和）。

交易产品乘数允许我们微调每个交易产品对成交比率的影响权重。较小的交易产品乘数（<1）适用于小币对及合约，在交易这些币对、合约时，为达到相同交易量往往需要更多的订单。所有的交易产品都有默认乘数，部分交易产品有独立的乘数。详情请见下表。

业务线 | 覆盖规则 | 独立乘数 | 默认乘数  
---|---|---|---  
永续 | 产品ID | `1`   
产品ID：   
BTC-USDT-SWAP   
BTC-USD-SWAP   
ETH-USDT-SWAP   
ETH-USD-SWAP | `0.2`  
交割 | 交易品种 | `0.3`   
交易品种：   
BTC-USDT   
BTC-USD   
ETH-USDT   
ETH-USD | `0.1`  
币币 | 产品ID | `0.5`   
产品ID：   
BTC-USDT   
ETH-USDT | `0.1`  
期权 | 交易品种 |  | `0.1`  
  
成交比率计算不包括大宗交易，价差交易，做市商保护（MMP），以及法币类型订单对应的订单数量；并且不包括大宗交易，价差交易对应的交易量。仅考虑 `sCode = 0` 的成功请求。  

每日 08:00 UTC，系统将根据UTC时间 00:00 的数据快照，选取子账户成交比率及母账户合计成交比率中的较大值决定子账户的未来限速。详情请见下表。对于独立经纪商，系统只会取子账户的成交比率。

| 成交比率[x<=比率<y) | 子账户每2秒限速(新订单及修改订单请求)  
---|---|---  
Tier 1 | [0,1) | 1,000  
Tier 2 | [1,2) | 1,250  
Tier 3 | [2,3) | 1,500  
Tier 4 | [3,5) | 1,750  
Tier 5 | [5,10) | 2,000  
Tier 6 | [10,20) | 2,500  
Tier 7 | [20,50) | 3,000  
Tier 8 | >= 50 | 10,000  
  
若成交比率和预期限速有所改善，则提升将于 08:00 (UTC) 立即生效。但若成交比率下降，需要降低未来限速，系统将给予一天的宽限期，降低后的速率限制将在 T+1 08:00 (UTC) 实施。在 T+1 时，若成交比率提高，则将立即授予更高的限速。若用户的交易手续费等级降级为 VIP4，其限速将降低为最低档位，并有一天的宽限期。

  

若子账户7日交易量低于1,000,000 USDT，则按照母账户的合计成交比率实施限速。

  

对于新创建的子账户，创建时将应用最低档位限速，在 T+1 08:00 (UTC)时，将开始应用上述限速规则。

  

大宗交易、价差交易、做市商保护（MMP）以及币币、币币杠杆订单不受子账户限速限制。

  

交易所提供 [GET / 获取账户限速](/docs-v5/zh/#order-book-trading-trade-get-account-rate-limit) 接口以便用户查询成交比率以及限速数据，数据将于每天 08:00 (UTC) 更新。该接口将返回子账户成交比率，母账户合计成交比率，子账户当前限速以及 T+1 时的预期子账户限速（适用于限速降级）。

  

成交比率、限速计算样例如下。用户有三个账户，交易产品 BTC-USDT-SWAP 及 XRP-USDT 的乘数分别为1，0.1。

  1. 账户 A（母账户）： 
     1. BTC-USDT-SWAP 交易量为100 USDT，订单数量为10;
     2. XRP-USDT 交易量为20 USDT，订单数量为15;
     3. 子账户成交比率 = (100+20) / (10 * 1 + 15 * 0.1) = 10.4
  2. 账户 B (子账户)： 
     1. BTC-USDT-SWAP 交易量为200 USDT，订单数量为100;
     2. XRP-USDT 交易量为20 USDT，订单数量为30;
     3. 子账户成交比率 = (200+20) / (100 * 1 + 30 * 0.1) = 2.13
  3. 账户 C (子账户)： 
     1. BTC-USDT-SWAP 交易量为300 USDT，订单数量为100;
     2. XRP-USDT 交易量为20 USDT，订单数量为45;
     3. 子账户成交比率 = (300+20) / (100 * 1 + 45 * 0.1) = 3.06
  4. 母账户合计成交比率 = (100+20+200+20+300+20) / (10 * 1 + 15 * 0.1 + 100 * 1 + 30 * 0.1 + 100 * 1 + 45 * 0.1) = 3.01
  5. 账户限速 
     1. 账户 A = max(10.4, 3.01) = 10.4 -> 2500订单请求/2秒
     2. 账户 B = max(2.13, 3.01) = 3.01 -> 1750订单请求/2秒
     3. 账户 C = max(3.06, 3.01) = 3.06 -> 1750订单请求/2秒

### 最佳实践 

如果您需要的请求速率高于我们的限速，您可以设置不同的子账户来批量请求限速。 我们建议使用此方法来限制或间隔请求，以最大化每个帐户的限速并避免断开连接或拒绝请求。
