**移动止盈止损**

移动止盈止损是一种跟踪市场价格的止盈止损，它的触发价格会跟随市场波动而变化，触发成功后会下市价单。  
实际触发价格的计算：卖出或开空时，实际触发价格 = 下单成功后最高价-回调幅度 (价距)，或下单成功后最高价 *(1-回调幅度 %) (比例)；买入或开多，实际触发价格 = 下单成功后最低价 + 回调幅度，或下单成功后最低价 *(1+ 回调幅度 %)。同时，您可以利用激活价格来设置委托被激活的价格。

callbackSpread | String | 可选 | 回调幅度的价距

激活价格是移动止盈止损的激活条件，当市场最新成交价达到或超过激活价格，委托被激活。激活后系统开始计算止盈止损的实际触发价格。如果不填写激活价格，即下单后就被激活。  
reduceOnly | Boolean | 否 | 是否只减仓，`true` 或 `false`，默认`false`  
该参数仅在 `交割/永续` 的买卖模式下有效，开平模式忽略此参数  
  
**时间加权**

时间加权是一种大额订单拆分后分时吃单的策略。  
用户在进行大额交易时，为避免对市场造成过大冲击，需要将大单委托自动拆为多笔委托。
