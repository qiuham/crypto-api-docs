tdMode  
Trade Mode, when placing an order, you need to specify the trade mode.  
**Spot mode:**  
\- SPOT and OPTION buyer: cash  
**Futures mode:**  
\- Isolated MARGIN: isolated  
\- Cross MARGIN: cross  
\- SPOT: cash  
\- Cross FUTURES/SWAP/OPTION: cross

\- Isolated FUTURES/SWAP/OPTION: isolated  clOrdId  
clOrdId is a user-defined unique ID used to identify the order. It will be included in the response parameters if you have specified during order submission, and can be used as a request parameter to the endpoints to query, cancel and amend orders.   
clOrdId must be unique among the clOrdIds of all pending orders.  posSide  
Position side, this parameter is not mandatory in **net** mode. If you pass it through, the only valid value is **net**.  
In **long/short** mode, it is mandatory. Valid values are **long** or **short**.  
In **long/short** mode, **side** and **posSide** need to be specified in the combinations below:  
Open long: buy and open long (side: fill in buy; posSide: fill in long)  
Open short: sell and open short (side: fill in sell; posSide: fill in short)  
Close long: sell and close long (side: fill in sell; posSide: fill in long)  
Close short: buy and close short (side: fill in buy; posSide: fill in short)  
Portfolio margin mode: Expiry Futures and Perpetual Futures only support net mode  ordType   
Order type. When creating a new order, you must specify the order type. The order type you specify will affect: 1) what order parameters are required, and 2) how the matching system executes your order. The following are valid order types:   
limit: Limit order, which requires specified sz and px.   
market: Market order. For SPOT and MARGIN, market order will be filled with market price (by swiping opposite order book). For Expiry Futures and Perpetual Futures, market order will be placed to order book with most aggressive price allowed by Price Limit Mechanism. For OPTION, market order is not supported yet. As the filled price for market orders cannot be determined in advance, OKX reserves/freezes your quote currency by an additional 5% for risk check.   
post_only: Post-only order, which the order can only provide liquidity to the market and be a maker. If the order would have executed on placement, it will be canceled instead.   
fok: Fill or kill order. If the order cannot be fully filled, the order will be canceled. The order would not be partially filled.   
ioc: Immediate or cancel order. Immediately execute the transaction at the order price, cancel the remaining unfilled quantity of the order, and the order quantity will not be displayed in the order book.   
optimal_limit_ioc: Market order with ioc (immediate or cancel). Immediately execute the transaction of this market order, cancel the remaining unfilled quantity of the order, and the order quantity will not be displayed in the order book. Only applicable to Expiry Futures and Perpetual Futures.  sz  
Quantity to buy or sell.   
For SPOT/MARGIN Buy and Sell Limit Orders, it refers to the quantity in base currency.   
For MARGIN Buy Market Orders, it refers to the quantity in quote currency.   
For MARGIN Sell Market Orders, it refers to the quantity in base currency.   
For SPOT Market Orders, it is set by tgtCcy.   
For FUTURES/SWAP/OPTION orders, it refers to the number of contracts.  reduceOnly  
When placing an order with this parameter set to true, it means that the order will reduce the size of the position only  
For the same MARGIN instrument, the coin quantity of all reverse direction pending orders adds `sz` of new `reduceOnly` order cannot exceed the position assets. After the debt is paid off, if there is a remaining size of orders, the position will not be opened in reverse, but will be traded in SPOT.  
For the same FUTURES/SWAP instrument, the sum of the current order size and all reverse direction reduce-only pending orders which's price-time priority is higher than the current order, cannot exceed the contract quantity of position.  
Only applicable to `Futures mode` and `Multi-currency margin`  
Only applicable to `MARGIN` orders, and `FUTURES`/`SWAP` orders in `net` mode  
Notice: Under long/short mode of Expiry Futures and Perpetual Futures, all closing orders apply the reduce-only feature which is not affected by this parameter.  tgtCcy  
This parameter is used to specify the order quantity in the order request is denominated in the quantity of base or quote currency. This is applicable to SPOT Market Orders only.  
Base currency: base_ccy  
Quote currency: quote_ccy   
If you use the Base Currency quantity for buy market orders or the Quote Currency for sell market orders, please note:   
1\. If the quantity you enter is greater than what you can buy or sell, the system will execute the order according to your maximum buyable or sellable quantity. If you want to trade according to the specified quantity, you should use Limit orders.   
2\. When the market price is too volatile, the locked balance may not be sufficient to buy the Base Currency quantity or sell to receive the Quote Currency that you specified. We will change the quantity of the order to execute the order based on best effort principle based on your account balance. In addition, we will try to over lock a fraction of your balance to avoid changing the order quantity.   
2.1 Example of base currency buy market order:   
Taking the market order to buy 10 LTCs as an example, and the user can buy 11 LTC. At this time, if 10 < 11, the order is accepted. When the LTC-USDT market price is 200, and the locked balance of the user is 3,000 USDT, as 200*10 < 3,000, the market order of 10 LTC is fully executed; If the market is too volatile and the LTC-USDT market price becomes 400, 400*10 > 3,000, the user's locked balance is not sufficient to buy using the specified amount of base currency, the user's maximum locked balance of 3,000 USDT will be used to settle the trade. Final transaction quantity becomes 3,000/400 = 7.5 LTC.   
2.2 Example of quote currency sell market order:   
Taking the market order to sell 1,000 USDT as an example, and the user can sell 1,200 USDT, 1,000 < 1,200, the order is accepted. When the LTC-USDT market price is 200, and the locked balance of the user is 6 LTC, as 1,000/200 < 6, the market order of 1,000 USDT is fully executed; If the market is too volatile and the LTC-USDT market price becomes 100, 100*6 < 1,000, the user's locked balance is not sufficient to sell using the specified amount of quote currency, the user's maximum locked balance of 6 LTC will be used to settle the trade. Final transaction quantity becomes 6 * 100 = 600 USDT.  px  
The value for px must be a multiple of tickSz for OPTION orders.  
If not, the system will apply the rounding rules below. Using tickSz 0.0005 as an example:  
The px will be rounded up to the nearest 0.0005 when the remainder of px to 0.0005 is more than 0.00025 or `px` is less than 0.0005.  
The px will be rounded down to the nearest 0.0005 when the remainder of px to 0.0005 is less than 0.00025 and `px` is more than 0.0005.  Mandatory self trade prevention (STP)  
The trading platform imposes mandatory self trade prevention at master account level, which means the accounts under the same master account, including master account itself and all its affiliated sub-accounts, will be prevented from self trade. The account-level acctStpMode will be used to place orders by default. The default value of this field is `cancel_maker`. Users can log in to the webpage through the master account to modify this configuration. Users can also utilize the stpMode request parameter of the placing order endpoint to determine the stpMode of a certain order.  
Mandatory self trade prevention will not lead to latency.   
There are three STP modes. The STP mode is always taken based on the configuration in the taker order.  
1\. Cancel Maker: This is the default STP mode, which cancels the maker order to prevent self-trading. Then, the taker order continues to match with the next order based on the order book priority.  
2\. Cancel Taker: The taker order is canceled to prevent self-trading. If the user's own maker order is lower in the order book priority, the taker order is partially filled and then canceled. FOK orders are always honored and canceled if they would result in self-trading.  
3\. Cancel Both: Both taker and maker orders are canceled to prevent self-trading. If the user's own maker order is lower in the order book priority, the taker order is partially filled. Then, the remaining quantity of the taker order and the first maker order are canceled. FOK orders are not supported in this mode.  Rate limit of orders tagged as isElpTakerAccess:true  
\- 50 orders per 2 seconds per User ID per instrument ID.  
\- This rate limit is shared in Place order/Place multiple orders endpoints in REST/WebSocket

clOrdId  
clOrdId是用户自定义的唯一ID用来识别订单。如果在请求参数中传入了，那它一定会在返回参数内，并且可以用于查询订单，撤销订单，修改订单等接口。 clOrdId不能与当前所有的挂单的clOrdId重复  posSide  
持仓方向，买卖模式下此参数非必填，如果填写仅可以选择net；在开平仓模式下必填，且仅可选择 long 或 short。  
开平仓模式下，side和posSide需要进行组合  
开多：买入开多（side 填写 buy； posSide 填写 long ）  
开空：卖出开空（side 填写 sell； posSide 填写 short ）  
平多：卖出平多（side 填写 sell；posSide 填写 long ）  
平空：买入平空（side 填写 buy； posSide 填写 short ）  
组合保证金模式：交割和永续仅支持买卖模式  ordType  
订单类型，创建新订单时必须指定，您指定的订单类型将影响需要哪些订单参数和撮合系统如何执行您的订单，以下是有效的ordType：  
普通委托：  
limit：限价单，要求指定sz 和 px  
market：市价单，币币和币币杠杆，是市价委托吃单；交割合约和永续合约，是自动以最高买/最低卖价格委托，遵循限价机制；期权合约不支持市价委托；由于市价委托无法确定成交价格，为确保有足够的资产买入设定数量的交易币种，会多冻结5%的计价币资产  
高级委托：  
post_only：限价委托，在下单那一刻只做maker，如果该笔订单的任何部分会吃掉当前挂单深度，则该订单将被全部撤销。  
fok：限价委托，全部成交或立即取消，如果无法全部成交该笔订单，则该订单将被全部撤销。  
ioc：限价委托，立即成交并取消剩余，立即按照委托价格撮合成交，并取消该订单剩余未完成数量，不会在深度列表上展示委托数量。  
optimal_limit_ioc：市价委托，立即成交并取消剩余，仅适用于交割合约和永续合约。  sz  
交易数量，表示要购买或者出售的数量。  
当币币/币币杠杆以限价买入和卖出时，指交易货币数量。  
当币币杠杆以市价买入时，指计价货币的数量。  
当币币杠杆以市价卖出时，指交易货币的数量。  
对于币币市价单，单位由 tgtCcy 决定  
当交割、永续、期权买入和卖出时，指合约张数。  reduceOnly  
只减仓，下单时，此参数设置为 true 时，表示此笔订单具有减仓属性，只会减少持仓数量，不会增加新的持仓仓位  
对于同一杠杆产品，所有反方向挂单的币数加上当前只减仓下单数量，不能超过仓位资产；负债还完后，如果还有剩余的委托数量，不会反向开仓，而是会进行币币交易。  
对于同一交割/永续产品，当前只减仓下单张数，加上价格时间优先于当前只减仓下单的只减仓挂单张数总和，不能超过持仓数量  
仅适用于`合约模式`和`跨币种保证金模式`  
仅适用于`币币杠杆`，以及买卖模式下的`交割/永续`  
注意：交割和永续合约在开平仓模式下，所有的平仓单都有只减仓逻辑，不受该字段传值的影响。  tgtCcy  
市价单委托数量`sz`的单位：仅适用于币币市价下单交易。  
交易货币：base_ccy  
计价货币：quote_ccy   
您在使用交易货币买入或者计价货币卖出时，请知晓：   
1.如果您输入的数量大于当前可买或者可卖的数量，系统将按照您的最大可买或者可卖数量帮您完成交易，如果您希望按照指定数量成交，那您可以尝试使用限价单，等待市场价格波动到锁定的余额可以买入或卖出您指定的数量。   
2.如果您输入的数量不大于当前可买或者可卖的数量，那当市场价格波动过大时，锁定的余额可能没办法买入您输入的交易货币数量或卖出您输入的计价货币数量，为保证您的交易体验，我们基于【能买多少买多少】或者【能卖多少卖多少】的原则，更改下单的数量帮您完成交易。此外，我们将尽量多锁定一点余额来规避更改下单数量的情况。   
2.1 交易币买入例子：   
以市价下单 买入 10个LTC为例，用户可买为11个，此时 10 < 11，挂单成功。当LTC-USDT的市价为200，用户被锁定余额为3,000 USDT，200*10 < 3,000，最终成交10个LTC； 若市场波动过大，LTC-USDT的市价为400，此时400*10 > 3,000，当用户被锁定的余额不够买入下单指定的交易货币数量时，系統使用用户被锁定的最大余额3,000 USDT下单买入，最终成交 3,000/400 = 7.5个 LTC。   
2.2 计价币卖出例子：   
以市价下单 卖出 1,000USDT为例，用户可卖为1,200USDT，1,000 < 1,200，挂单成功。LTC-USDT的市价为200，用户被锁定的余额为6个LTC，最终成交5个LTC； 若市场波动过大，LTC-USDT的市价为100，100*6 < 1,000，当用户被锁定的余额不够卖出下单指定的计价货币数量时，系統使用用户被锁定的最大余额6个LTC下单，最终成交 6 * 100 = 600 USDT。  px  
期权下单时，委托价格需为 tickSz 的整数倍。  
当不为整数倍时，取值规则以tickSz取 0.0005 为例：  
当委托价格对0.0005的余数大于0.00025或者委托价格小于0.0005时，向上取；  
当委托价格对0.0005的余数小于等于0.00025，且委托价格大于0.0005时，向下取。  强制自成交保护  
交易系统会以母账户维度实施强制自成交保护，同一母账户下所有账户，包括母账户本身和所有子账户，都无法进行自成交。默认使用账户层面的acctStpMode进行下单，该字段的默认值为`cancel_maker`，用户可通过母账户登录网页修改该配置；用户亦可以通过下单接口的stpMode参数指定订单的STP模式。用户亦可以通过下单接口的stpMode参数指定订单的STP模式。  
强制自成交保护不会导致延迟。  
有三种STP模式。STP模式始终基于taker订单中的配置。  
1.Cancel Maker：这是默认的STP模式，系统撤Maker订单以防止自成交。然后，taker订单会基于深度继续和下一个订单成交。  
2.Cancel Taker：撤Taker订单以防止自成交。如果用户的Maker订单不是深度里第一个订单，Taker订单会被部分成交，然后撤单。FOK订单会确保完全成交和自成交保护。  
3.Cancel Both：撤Taker和Maker订单以防止自成交。如果用户的Maker订单不是深度里第一个订单，Taker订单会被部分成交，然后Taker订单的剩余数量和第一个自我Maker订单被取消。此模式不支持FOK订单。
