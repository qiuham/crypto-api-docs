For market orders, it's likely the orders channel will show order state as "filled" while showing the "last filled quantity (fillSz)" as 0.  In exceptional cases, the same message may be sent multiple times (perhaps with the different uTime) . The following guidelines are advised:  
  
1\. If a `tradeId` is present, it means a fill. Each `tradeId` should only be returned once per instrument ID, and the later messages that have the same `tradeId` should be discarded.  
2\. If `tradeId` is absent and the `state` is "filled," it means that the `SPOT`/`MARGIN` market order is fully filled. For messages with the same `ordId`, process only the first filled message and discard any subsequent messages. State = filled is the terminal state of an order.  
3\. If the state is `canceled` or `mmp_canceled`, it indicates that the order has been canceled. For cancellation messages with the same `ordId`, process the first one and discard later messages. State = canceled / mmp_canceled is the terminal state of an order.  
4\. If `reqId` is present, it indicates a response to a user-requested order modification. It is recommended to use a unique `reqId` for each modification request. For modification messages with the same `reqId`, process only the first message received and discard subsequent messages.  The definitions for fillPx, tradeId, fillSz, fillPnl, fillTime, fillFee, fillFeeCcy, and execType differ between the REST order information endpoints and the orders channel.  The definitions for fillPx, tradeId, fillSz, fillPnl, fillTime, fillFee, fillFeeCcy, and execType differ between the REST order information endpoints and the orders channel.  Unlike futures contracts, option positions are automatically exercised or expire at maturity. The rights then terminate and no closing orders are generated. Therefore, this channel will not push any closing-order updates for expired options.

对于市价委托，订单频道推送消息会出现状态为“完全成交”，但最新成交数量 (fillSz) 为 0 的情况。  极端情况下，会出现同一条消息重复推送的情况（`uTime` 可能会不一样），建议做如下处理：  
  
* 当`tradeId`有值时，代表成交，对于同一`tradeId`，请以第一条推送消息为准，忽略后续的推送消息；  
* 当`tradeId`没有值且 `state` 为`filled`时，代表币币/杠杆市价单关闭，对于同一`ordId`的完全成交（state:filled）推送消息，请以第一条成交推送消息为准，忽略后续的推送消息；  
* 当`state`为`canceled`或者`mmp_canceled`时，代表订单撤销，对于同一`ordId`的撤单推送消息，请以第一条推送消息为准，忽略后续的推送消息；  
* 当`reqId`有值时，代表用户改单，改单时建议使用唯一的`reqId`，对于同一`reqId`的改单推送消息，请以第一条推送消息为准，忽略后续的推送消息。  REST 订单信息接口和订单频道在 fillPx、tradeId、fillSz、fillPnl、fillTime、fillFee、fillFeeCcy 和 execType 的定义上存在差异。  与交割合约不同，期权持仓到期之后，期权持仓在到期后会自动行权或作废，持仓本身随即消失，不会产生任何平仓订单，因此，该频道不会推送期权到期的平仓订单信息。
