# Advanced Trade WebSocket Rate Limits

The WebSocket feed is publicly available and its real-time market data updates provide the fastest insight into order flow and trades.

  * Advanced Trade API WebSocket connections are rate-limited at **8 per second per IP address**.
  * Advanced Trade API WebSocket unauthenticated messages are rate-limited at **8 per second per IP address**.

You are responsible for reading the message stream and using the messages relevant for your needs, such as building real-time order books and tracking real-time trades.
