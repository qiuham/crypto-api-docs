  * REST at `https://api.coinbase.com/api/v3/brokerage`
  * WebSocket at `wss://advanced-trade-ws.coinbase.com` (public) and `wss://advanced-trade-ws-user.coinbase.com` (private)

**International Derivatives** — migration notice.

  * On September 09, 2026 - Coinbase Advanced is moving international derivatives from INTX onto a Deribit-powered gateway running the next-generation Starbase engine.
  * JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP and WebSocket at `https://drb.coinbase.com`.

## Migration from INTX to Deribit-powered gateway
