WSSws-auth.kraken.com/v2add_order

Sends a single, new order into the exchange. A range of order types, Time-In-Force (TIF) and order flags can be specified by the parameters below. For triggered order types (`stop-loss`, `take-profit`, `trailing-stop`), the `triggers` section contains the parameters for price tracking and trigger thresholds. For One-Triggers-Other (OTO) orders, the `conditional` section contains the parameters to add a secondary close order to the primary order.

  * `limit`: The full order quantity is placed immediately with a limit price restriction to only trade at this price or better.
  * `market`: The full order quantity executes immediately at the best available price in the order book.
  * `iceberg`: Hides the full order size by only showing your chosen display size in the book at your limit price.

  * `stop-loss-limit`: A limit order is triggered when the reference price reaches the stop price (from an unfavourable direction).
  * `take-profit`: A market order is triggered when the reference price reaches the stop price (from a favourable direction).
  * `take-profit-limit`: A limit order is triggered when the reference price reaches the stop price (from a favourable direction).

  * `trailing-stop-limit`: A limit order is triggered when the market reverts a specified distance from the peak price.
  * `settle-position`: Settles an open leveraged position at the current market price.

side

string

required

One of: `buy`, `sell`Side of the order.

order_qty

float

required

Default: `quote`  
Condition: Only available on trailing-stop-limit ordersThe units for the limit price.

  * `static`: a static market price for the asset, i.e. 30000 for BTC/USD.
  * `pct`: a percentage offset from the reference price, i.e. -10% from index price.
  * `quote`: a notional offset from the reference price in the quote currency, i.e, 150 BTC/USD from last price.

Note, for `trailing-stop-limit` order type, the value represents offset from the trigger price. 0 would set a limit price the same as the trigger price.

triggers

Condition: Required for triggered order types onlyThe parameters for setting the trigger price conditions.

Hide properties

reference

string

One of: `index`, `last`  
Default: `last`The reference price to track for triggering orders.

  * `last`: the last traded price in the Kraken order book (for this pair).

price

float

required

Specifies the amount for the trigger price - it supports both static market prices and relative prices. This field is used in combination with the `price_type` field below to determine the effective trigger price.**Examples:**

  * To trigger at 29000.5 BTC/USD, use price=29000.5, price_type=static.
  * To trigger when price rises by 5%, use price=5, price_type=pct.
  * To trigger when price drops by 150 USD, use price=-150, price_type=quote.

  * `quote`: a notional offset from the reference price in the quote currency, i.e, 150 BTC/USD from last price.

Note, for `trailing-stop` and `trailing-stop-limit` order types, the price represents the reversion from the peak. It is always a positive value with `pct` or `quote` offset.

Example: `2022-12-25T09:30:59.123Z`Range of valid offsets (from current time) is 500 milliseconds to 60 seconds, default is 5 seconds. The precision of this parameter is to the millisecond. The engine will prevent this order from matching after this time, it provides protection against latency on time sensitive orders.

cl_ord_id

string

Adds a alphanumeric client order identifier which uniquely identifies an open order for each client. This field is mutually exclusive with `order_userref` parameter.The `cl_ord_id` parameter can be one of the following formats:

  * Long UUID: `6d1b345e-2821-40e2-ad83-4ecb18a06876` 32 hex characters separated with 4 dashes.

integer

This is an optional non-unique, numeric identifier which can associated with a number of orders by the client. This field is mutually exclusive with `cl_ord_id` parameter.Many clients choose a unique integer value generated by their systems (i.e. a timestamp). However, because we don’t enforce uniqueness on our side, it can also be used to easily tag a group of orders for querying or cancelling.

conditional

object

The conditional parameters are used as a template for generating the secondary close orders when the primary order fills. Each fill on the primary order will generate a new secondary order. The size of the secondary order will be the same size as the executed quantity and have the opposite side.

  * To trigger when price rises by 5%, use price=5, price_type=pct.
  * To trigger when price drops by 150 USD, use price=-150, price_type=quote.
