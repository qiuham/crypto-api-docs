#### Authorizations

APIKey

string

header

required

General API key with full access

Authent

string

header

required

Authentication string

#### Query Parameters

processBefore

string<date-time>

The time before which the request should be processed, otherwise it is rejected.

orderType

enum<string>

required

The order type:

  * `lmt` \- a limit order

  * `post` \- a post-only limit order

  * `mkt` \- an immediate-or-cancel order with 1% price protection

  * `stp` \- a stop order

  * `take_profit` \- a take profit order

  * `ioc` \- an immediate-or-cancel order

  * `trailing_stop` \- a trailing stop order

  * `fok` \- fill or kill order The order type:

  * `lmt` \- a limit order

  * `post` \- a post-only limit order

  * `mkt` \- an immediate-or-cancel order with 1% price protection

  * `stp` \- a stop order

  * `take_profit` \- a take profit order

  * `ioc` \- an immediate-or-cancel order

  * `trailing_stop` \- a trailing stop order

  * `fok` \- fill-or-kill order

`unknown` is returned when the source value couldn't be decoded; this will be replaced with a real value as soon as possible.

Available options:

`lmt`,

`post`,

`ioc`,

`mkt`,

`stp`,

`take_profit`,

`trailing_stop`,

`fok`,

`unknown`

symbol

string

required

The symbol of the Futures

side

enum<string>

required

The direction of the order. The direction of the order.

`unknown` is returned when the source value couldn't be decoded; this will be replaced with a real value as soon as possible.

Available options:

`buy`,

`sell`,

`unknown`

size

number

required

The size associated with the order. Note that different Futures have different contract sizes.

limitPrice

number

The limit price associated with the order. Note that for stop orders, limitPrice denotes the worst price at which the `stp` or `take_profit` order can get filled at. If no `limitPrice` is provided the `stp` or `take_profit` order will trigger a market order. If placing a `trailing_stop` order then leave undefined.

stopPrice

number

The stop price associated with a stop or take profit order.

Required if orderType is `stp` or `take_profit`, but if placing a `trailing_stop` then leave undefined. Note that for stop orders, limitPrice denotes the worst price at which the `stp` or `take_profit` order can get filled at. If no `limitPrice` is provided the `stp` or `take_profit` order will trigger a market order.

cliOrdId

string

The order identity that is specified from the user. It must be globally unique.

Maximum string length: `100`

triggerSignal

enum<string>

If placing a `stp`, `take_profit` or `trailing_stop`, the signal used for trigger.

  * `mark` \- the mark price
  * `index` \- the index price
  * `last` \- the last executed trade

Available options:

`mark`,

`index`,

`last`

reduceOnly

boolean

Set as true if you wish the order to only reduce an existing position.

Any order which increases an existing position will be rejected. Default false.

trailingStopMaxDeviation

number

Required if the order type is `trailing_stop`. Maximum value of 50%, minimum value of 0.1% for 'PERCENT' 'maxDeviationUnit'.

Is the maximum distance the trailing stop's trigger price may trail behind the requested trigger signal. It defines the threshold at which the trigger price updates.

Required range: `0.1 <= x <= 50`

trailingStopDeviationUnit

enum<string>

Required if the order type is `trailing_stop`.

This defines how the trailing trigger price is calculated from the requested trigger signal. For example, if the max deviation is set to 10, the unit is 'PERCENT', and the underlying order is a sell, then the trigger price will never be more then 10% below the trigger signal. Similarly, if the deviation is 100, the unit is 'QUOTE_CURRENCY', the underlying order is a sell, and the contract is quoted in USD, then the trigger price will never be more than $100 below the trigger signal.

`unknown` is returned when the source value couldn't be decoded; this will be replaced with a real value as soon as possible.

Available options:

`PERCENT`,

`QUOTE_CURRENCY`,

`unknown`

limitPriceOffsetValue

number

Can only be set for triggers, e.g. order types `take_profit`, `stop` and `trailing_stop`. If set, `limitPriceOffsetUnit` must be set as well. This defines a relative limit price depending on the trigger `stopPrice`. The price is determined when the trigger is activated by the `triggerSignal`. The offset can be positive or negative, there might be restrictions on the value depending on the `limitPriceOffsetUnit`.

limitPriceOffsetUnit

enum<string>

Can only be set together with `limitPriceOffsetValue`. This defines the unit for the relative limit price distance from the trigger's `stopPrice`.

Available options:

`QUOTE_CURRENCY`,

`PERCENT`

broker

string

Valid Broker identifier on whose behalf the order is sent.

Note: This is currently available exclusively in the Kraken pre-prod environments.

Maximum string length: `100`
